         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And ſo the ſaid <hi>Titus Oats</hi> hath committed wilful and corrupt Perjury. And the Indictment further ſets forth, That upon the 13th. day of <hi>June,</hi> in the 31ſt. Year of the late King, <hi>Thomas White,</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Whitebread, John Fenwick, William Harcourt,</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Harriſon, John Gaven,</hi> and <hi>Anthony Turner,</hi> were Indicted and Tryed at the <hi>Old-Bayly</hi> for Treaſon; and at that Tryal, the ſaid <hi>Titus Oats</hi> was a Witneſs produc'd on the Part of the King: And being ſworn to teſtify the Truth, the whole Truth, and nothing but the Truth; by his own Act and Conſent, of his own moſt wicked Mind, falſly, voluntarily, and corruptly did depoſe, and ſwear, and give in Evidence to the <hi>Jury,</hi> That <hi>William Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (one <hi>William Ireland,</hi> before that time Convicted and Executed for High Treaſon, meaning) did take his Leave of him the ſaid <hi>Titus Oats,</hi> at his the ſaid <hi>William Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s Chamber, then being in <hi>Ruſſel-Street,</hi> between the 8th. and 12th.

                  <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen of the Jury; Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> ſtands Indicted for having perjur'd himſelf: The Inſtances, Gentlemen, that we charge him with, are theſe: Firſt, What he ſwore at the Tryal of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and we ſay, that at that Tryal he did ſwear <hi>Ireland</hi> was in Town the 1ſt. or 2d. of <hi>September,</hi> 1678. The ſecond inſtance is, What he ſwore at the Tryal of the five <hi>Jeſuites;</hi> and there we ſay, he did ſwear, That <hi>Ireland</hi> was in Town between the 8th. and 12th. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and that he took his leave of him here in Town at his Chamber in <hi>Ruſſel-ſtreet;</hi> and we do charge him by this Indictment, that he has forſworn himſelf in both Inſtances: And that <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Gentlemen, was neither in Town between the 8th. and 12th. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> nor the 1ſt. or 2d. of <hi>September.</hi> And we ſhall make it out very evidently; For, Gentlemen, as to the proof in this Caſe, our Caſe ſtands thus; We ſay, That the 3d. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1678. <hi>Ireland</hi> went into <hi>Hartfordſhire,</hi> to a Houſe of my Lord <hi>Aſtons;</hi> and from thence went into <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire.</hi>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:178846:5"/> I will not ſtand to open the Particulars, where he was every day; but we ſhall give you an account, in a method very eaſy to be remembred and obſerv'd, where he was till the 14th. of <hi>September.</hi> But one Remarkable Inſtance, Gentlemen, I deſire to take particular notice of; and that is, the time of <hi>Pancraſs</hi>-Fair, which is upon the 2d. of <hi>September</hi> alwayes, a known day, and a known place in that Country. Now we have among the reſt, many Witneſſes to prove, That Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> was there that day, and not in Town. And when we have proved this, as we ſhall by a whole Cloud of Witneſſes, I believe, you Gentlemen of this Jury, will no more doubt, that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> is Forſworn in theſe Particulars, than the Jury Yeſterday did in that particular; nor than, I believe, the whole Kingdom does by this time.</p>

                  <p>No, Sir, I have them not here; but I have had them by me this four or five Years, or more. It was my manner in all the Tryals, wherein I was concern'd as a Jury-Man, to Read the Tryals ſtrictly over, when they were printed, eſpecially where
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:178846:6"/> I happen'd to have any Notes, that I took at the Tryal; and to compare the printed Tryal with my Notes; and where I found any thing doubtful, I uſed to put a Query upon it. And this and many other things, I found to be in the Printed Tryal ſtrictly according to my Notes.</p>

                  <p>I was one of the <hi>Jury</hi> at the Tryal of Mr. <hi>Ireland,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pickering,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Grove;</hi> and I did ſee Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> ſworn, as a Witneſs for the King, at that Tryal; and ſo was Mr. <hi>Bedloe:</hi> And <hi>Bedloe</hi> there gave Evidence, That there was a Meeting at <hi>Harcourt</hi>'s Chamber; and <hi>Ireland, Grove,</hi> and <hi>Pickering</hi> was there: And that this was the later End of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> did make his Defence, as much as he could, to prove, That he was not in Town from the Beginning of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> to the Middle of <hi>September;</hi> and brought divers Witneſſes. But upon his denying to be here the later End of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi> Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> did come and ſwear: <hi>I am certain,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that the Firſt or Second of</hi> September, <hi>he was in Town; for then I had of him Twenty Shillings.</hi>

                  <speaker>Lord Ch. Juſt.</speaker>

                  <p>It is not neceſſary, that you ſhould uſe the word <hi>Poſitive:</hi> The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, Whether it was poſitively affirm'd?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Oats.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, I'll tell you the Reaſon why I ask the Queſtion, becauſe I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got my ſelf, whether I us'd the Word or no; and therefore, I ask for my own Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation now.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, ask for what Reaſon you will, you have receiv'd an Anſwer to your Queſtion; and, upon my Word, he gives a notable Evidence: Says he, <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loe</hi> had ſworn a Treaſonable Practice by <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the later End of <hi>August.</hi> Then <hi>Ireland</hi> comes, and makes his Defence: Says he, <hi>That cannot be; for I was out of Town at that time: I was not in</hi> London <hi>all</hi> Auguſt, <hi>nor the Beginning of</hi> September. Then come you in, to ſupport the Teſtimony of <hi>Bedloe;</hi> and ſwear, That he was in Town the Firſt or Second of <hi>September;</hi> for then he gave you Twenty Shillings. And ſo you come to rivet the Matter that was ſworn before by <hi>Bedloe.</hi>

                  <p>I do not ſay, He; but, I am ſure, his Siſter, and the Company, ſtay'd out that Night.

And I remember well, he did not come to Town again, till a Fortnight before <hi>Michaelmas.</hi>

                  <p>No, there you are miſtaken, too. But I tell you what I did obſerve before.

But now, when I put her in mind to take care what ſhe ſaid, ſhe ſwears, She is ſure, the Siſter lay out; but ſhe is not ſure of <hi>Ireland</hi>'s lying out: But ſhe is poſitive, he went away on the <hi>Saturday</hi> the Third of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and return'd not till a Fortnight before <hi>Michaelmas.</hi>

                  <p>I cannot charge my Memory, my Lord, that he did, ſo as particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſwear it: But there he came into my Company ſometimes at <hi>Tixhall;</hi> but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell the particular Days: Nor could I ſpeak poſitively in thoſe things that I have ſpoke to now, but that I find in my Note book, that at that time he did come to my Houſe at <hi>Standen,</hi> and did go with me to St. <hi>Albans.</hi>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>I cannot ſay poſitively that, Mr. <hi>Attorney;</hi> but I have a general No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he did. Nor could I teſtifie this ſo poſitively, I ſay, but by Notes that I have

                  <p>I had no buſineſs with him at all; but he deſired the opportunity, to go down in my Company into <hi>Staffordſhire.</hi>

                  </p>

                  <speaker>Oats.</speaker>
                  <p>Then I would ask my Lord, If he ſaw Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> Executed?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord <hi>Aston.</hi>

                  <speaker>Oats.</speaker>
                  <p>Then I would ask him this Queſtion; Whether the <hi>Ireland</hi> that was Executed, be the ſame <hi>Ireland</hi> he ſpeaks of?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord <hi>Aſton.</hi>

                  <speaker>Oats.</speaker>
                  <p>That is but hear-ſay, my Lord; He does not ſpeak of his own knowledg.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
                  <p>For that matter. I ſuppoſe, you'l produce ſome other <hi>Ireland,</hi> Mr. <hi>Oats,</hi> If it was not the ſame.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Att. Gen.</hi>

                  <speaker>Lord Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
                  <p>That is all one. If any body ſhould ask me, if you were the ſame Mr. <hi>Oats,</hi> that was at St. <hi>Omers;</hi> I ſhould ſay, I heard ſo; and it would be very good Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, unleſs ſome one elſe were produc'd.</p>

                  <p>Then my Lord is not poſitive, he went with him into <hi>Staffordſhire.</hi>

                  <p>No, he is not; but I would ask you this Queſtion. My Lord <hi>Aſton,</hi> do you believe he went with you to <hi>Tixhall?</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord <hi>Aston.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>I make no doubt of it, I would pawn all I have in the World upon it; only I cannot ſwear it, becauſe I have it not in my Notes; as I have thoſe two other dayes.</p>

                  <p>In the Year of our Lord 1678. my Maſter Sir <hi>John Southcoat,</hi> went with my Lady, on <hi>Monday</hi> the Fifth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> to St. <hi>Albans;</hi> and we came with a Coach, and Four Horſes: For my Maſter-had an old Servant, that had a pair of Horſes, which my Maſter made uſe of. And there we met my Lord <hi>Aſton,</hi> in the Company of Mr. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And the next Morning, my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> went with my Maſter and Lady towards <hi>Tixhall:</hi> And I rode by, in Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi>'s Company; and came acquainted with him that Day. That Night we came to <hi>Northampton;</hi> and there we Inn'd at a Stone-Houſe, that was us'd for the Inn, the Town being burnt before. The next Night we went to <hi>Coventry;</hi> and on <hi>Thurſday</hi> we came to <hi>Tixhall:</hi> there we ſtay'd till <hi>Tueſday.</hi> After when we went to <hi>Holy-Well;</hi> and the <hi>Tueſday</hi>-Night we lay at <hi>Natwich.</hi> And thence we went to <hi>Holy-Well,</hi> and ſtay'd there on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> Night: And on <hi>Thurſday</hi> we came to <hi>Weſt Cheſter;</hi> and I parted with him upon the <hi>Fryday</hi> at <hi>Weſt-Cheſter.</hi>

                  <p>My Lord, I ſaw him at his Tryal, the hair of his face was grown, and he was a little diſordered; he did not look ſo well, becauſe he was not ſo well dreſs'd; but it was the ſame man, my Lord.</p>

Upon the <hi>Fryday,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> ſold his Horſe to Mr. <hi>John Southcoat,</hi> my Maſters Son. Upon the <hi>Saturday</hi> morning, I came with him from my Maſters Houſe towards <hi>London;</hi> he did ride upon the Horſe he had ſold to Mr. <hi>Southcoat,</hi> and ſo we came up to Town, and took Water; and I took a little bagg that belonged to Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> upon my arm, and we landed at <hi>Somerſet-Houſe,</hi> and I came with him to his Lodging in <hi>Ruſſel-ſtreet;</hi> and when he came there, he went up ſtairs, where were two Women met him, and welcom'd him home: Said they, <hi>We are glad you are come, we thought we had loſt you, becauſe we had never heard from you all this while.</hi> There I took my leave of him, and did not ſee him again till his Tryal at the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> and this was <hi>Saturday</hi> the 14th. of <hi>September.</hi>

                  <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, here is an Indictment exhibited againſt me, which ſets forth, that I ſhould ſwear at Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi>'s Tryal, that Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> was in Town the firſt and ſecond of <hi>September;</hi> and it ſets forth, that in truth he was not in Town: And likewiſe it ſets forth, that I ſwore at the Tryal of the five Jeſuits, that Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> took his leave of me and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers here in Town at his Lodging in <hi>Ruſſel-ſtreet,</hi> between the 8th and 12th of <hi>Auguſt;</hi> whereas the Perjury there aſſigned, is this, That he did not take his leave of me or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon, betwixt the 8th and 12th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> at his Lodging in <hi>Ruſſel-ſtreet.</hi> Now, my Lord, I was not the onely Witneſs of Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi>'s being in Town in the month of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt;</hi> nor the onely Witneſs of his being in Town about that time in <hi>September.</hi> My Lord, my Proſecutors have endeavoured to maintain this Charge againſt me, thus: The firſt thing they have gone upon, as far as I can remember in the Indictment, is as to the firſt or ſecond of <hi>September,</hi> or rather they have endeavoured to prove both under one. Now in anſwer to all this Evidence, my Lord, the firſt thing I ſhall offer to your Lordſhips conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and the conſideration of the Jury, is the great hardſhip I lie under, after ſix years time to be put to diſprove what the Counſel here have now offered againſt me. My Lord, I obſerve firſt, that this Indictment which is now upon tryal, is founded upon the Tryal of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which was the 17th of <hi>December</hi> 1678, at the <hi>Old-baily,</hi> and it is now ſix years after that Evidence of mine was delivered. A ſecond thing is, that the Indictment is found by ſpecial Commiſſion, as appears by the Indictment it ſelf. Now I muſt recommend to the conſideration of your Lordſhip, and this Jury, why the proſecution of this pretended Perjury has been delayed ſo long, when it appears by the Evidence which has been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, that the Witneſſes to prove it, were known ſix years ſince, as much as they are now; and there is no colour of Evidence offered, that any new Fact has been lately diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered which was not then known. There is no reaſon, my Lord, that is aſſigned or can be aſſigned for this delay, but onely that the hardſhip might be the greater upon me: for now it is difficult, if not impoſſible, for me to maintain the Evidence I then gave, ſo many perſons being ſince dead or gone beyond the Seas, and many things that were freſh then, are now grown out of memory; and I beg your favour to inſiſt upon this, and I think it cannot be denied me. If ſuch a Practice as this be admitted, no Witneſs is ſafe in giving his Teſtimony againſt any Conſpirators whatſoever. For, my Lord, I muſt deſire leave to offer another thing to your conſideration, before I ſpeak to the particular Evidence, and that is this, That here is nothing but a bare point of time upon which this Perjury is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned; when the ſubſtance of the Teſtimony that I gave at the Tryals of Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> and the reſt about the Popiſh Plot, is not aſſigned as any Perjury at all; it is only a circumſtance of Time and Place: And, my Lord, I ſhall offer this to your further conſideration, that <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was convicted for a Treaſonable Reſolution to murder the late King, and not for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Town in <hi>Auguſt</hi> or <hi>September</hi> 78, or elſewhere; and he was not convicted for his being in his Chamber in <hi>Ruſſel-ſtreet,</hi> and taking his leave there in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> which is one matter of the Perjury now aſſigned. Next, my Lord, 'tis hard and unreaſonable to tye up VVitneſſes that come to diſcover Plots and Conſpiracies, to ſpeak poſitively as to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of Time and Place; and every little Punctilio in their Evidence to bind them up to ſuch Niceties in the delivery of their Teſtimonies, as to Time and Place. It is uſual to ſpeak with Latitude, as to ſuch kind of things, and 'tis probable my Evidence, which is now in queſtion, was not, that <hi>Ireland</hi> was the firſt or ſecond of <hi>September</hi> poſitively here in Town; but, my Lord, I did (I believe) give my ſelf a Latitude, and would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine my ſelf to either the firſt or ſecond, fifth, ſixth, ſeventh, or eighth; but, my Lord, that he was in <hi>September</hi> there, I am poſitive: I muſt therefore beg your Lordſhips and the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:178846:20"/> Courts Opinion, whether that Mr. <hi>Foſter</hi> did prove that I was poſitive and preciſe to the days of the 1ſt and 2d of <hi>September</hi> 78.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                  <p>In my opinion it is a plain Evidence that you did ſwear poſitively to thoſe two days; and you ſpoke to a circumſtance very material in your Evidence, that either the firſt or ſecond of <hi>September</hi> you had twenty ſhillings of him in Town here: now that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his Kindneſs to you, was not a circumſtance either of time or place.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
                  <p>Then, my Lord, I ſhall begin with my Proofs: but, my Lord, I deſire I may have free liberty to mind my Buſineſs; for here is a Gentleman behind me that will not let me be at quiet, but is either medling with me or my Papers.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                  <p>Who is it? let me know him, and I will take care to make him quiet, or ſet him farther off. You Gentlemen that are at the Bar ſhould know better, one would think: He muſt have liberty to make his own defence; and if he complains and lets me know who meddles with him, they had better do ſomewhat elſe.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, the firſt thing that I offer is, that <hi>Ireland</hi> was convicted of Treaſon, and for that you have the Record.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                  <p>It is allowed of all ſides, that <hi>Ireland</hi> was convicted and attainted of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
                  <p>Then, my Lord, the principal Defence which, as near as I can remember, Mr. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> made at his Tryal, was an endeavour to prove that he was not in Town between the 8th and 12th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> nor the 1ſt and 2d days of <hi>September,</hi> which are the points now in Iſſue; and he then produced one Mr. <hi>Gifford</hi> and his Siſter and Mother; and fifteen or ſixteen Witneſſes were produced at Mr. <hi>Whitebreads:</hi> Tryal, of which there is another Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, that being ſix Months after Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> was Tried: There Mr. <hi>Whitebread</hi> produces ſeveral Witneſſes, Mr. <hi>Gifford,</hi> I ſay, and ſeveral others, I think to the number of ſixteen, which were to prove <hi>Ireland</hi>'s being out of Town in theſe times that theſe Witneſſes ſpeak of. Now, my Lord, all thoſe ſeveral Witneſſes being produced to prove <hi>Ireland</hi> then out of Town, the very point that is now in Iſſue, was then ſo: and notwithſtanding all thoſe Witneſſes, the Jurors who tryed Mr. <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Jurors who tryed Mr. <hi>Whitebread</hi> and the other four Jeſuites, found them Guilty; though they endeavoured with all their force imaginable to oppoſe my Teſtimony, and it was left to the Conſideration of the Jury what their Witneſſes had ſaid. If your Lordſhip pleaſes to remember, my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs</hi> did obſerve to the Jury, that the Evidence of the Priſoner at the Bar did conſiſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Punctilio's of time; which as near as I can remember what he ſays, he called a Nicety of time; and in <hi>Whitebreads</hi> Tryal he was pleaſed to call it Catching in point of time. And it was obſerv'd at <hi>Ireland</hi>'s Tryal, that his Defence was ſo weak that my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs</hi> upon the integrity of <hi>Bedloe</hi>'s Evidence and mine, uſes theſe words to the Jury, (though he then endeavoured to do what theſe Witneſſes do now): It is moſt plain the Plot is diſcovered, and that by theſe men, and that it is a Plot and a Villanous one; which ſhews not only the fulneſs and ſatisfactorineſs of our proof that we gave, but does al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo take notice of the little ſhifts and catching tricks he made uſe of to prove himſelf out of Town; which would not weigh with the Court: Therefore I obſerve it is but the ſame Objection that then was made, and is not a new one now. And my Lord Chief Juſtice that then was, ſpeaking of that proof he brought (which the Court heard with patience, but could eaſily ſee through the vanity of it) ſaid, What arts they have of evading this, I know not; for as they have turn'd their Learning into Subtelty, ſo they have their Religion too. All this is well remembred by thoſe that were by and heard that Tryal: And though <hi>Ireland</hi> laboured to diſprove me in that circumſtance of time, yet ſtill the Court did juſtifie the Evidence that Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> and my ſelf had given: And the ſame Chief Juſtice ſaid, I leave it to you to conſider, whether you have not as much Evidence from theſe two men as can be expected in a caſe of this nature; and whether Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> be not rather juſtified by the Teſtimony offered againſt him than diſcredited. This was after his Plea was debated and conſidered: and I muſt further obſerve to your Lordſhip, that though Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> by his falſe Witneſſes preſſed this matter as far as he could then, and urged the Court to believe it, yet when the Jury brought in their Verdict and found him Guilty, the Chief Juſtice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the ſatisfaction of the Court in theſe words: You have done, Gentlemen, like very good Subjects and very good Chriſtians; that is to ſay, like very good Proteſtants; and now much good may their 30000 Maſſes do them. This, my Lord, was the Caſe of Mr. <hi>Ireland,</hi> at his Tryal, and the ſame point of his being out of Town was again managed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a ſecond Jury at the Tryal of the Five Jeſuits; but the Court ſaw the deſign of the Popiſh Party to blemiſh the Evidence given of the Plot; but yet they lookt upon it only as
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:178846:20"/> a Trick: And my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Seroggs,</hi> in ſumming up the Evidence at that Tryal, ſays, They fall foul upon Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> meaning my ſelf; he appears to have been their Agent, and whilſt ſo, bad enough: But if he had not had a mind to have become a good man, he would not have done us that good he has done in the diſcovery of the deſign they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged him in. And if your Lordſhip pleaſe to remember, that at that Tryal of the Five Jeſuites, when all arts were uſed to prove <hi>Ireland</hi> out of Town, and me at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> in the ſame Charge to the Jury, my Lord <hi>Scroggs</hi> did take notice that the Jeſuites were very exact at catching in a point of time; but now ſays, that is a thing that no man can preciſely charge his memory withal; and therefore he does there perſwade the Jury, that that ſhould not be too ſtrictly the meaſure of their Judgments about Truth and Falſhood, by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake of ſeven or eight days; For, ſaid he to the Jury, examine your ſelves how often every day you do miſtake things that have been tranſacted half a year ago, and err in point of time, taking one week for another, and one month for another; and therefore you are not to lay too great a weight upon the point of time. Now if too great weight; my Lord, be not to be laid upon a point of time, then this Charge that is now brought againſt me is not of weight at all: And beſides, my Lord, this ought to be conſidered, if this were the great Objection then and then anſwered, it ceaſes to be an Objection now. And as the Court did obſerve at the ſumming up of the Evidence, that they made their defence about the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of a point of time, which was no defence at all. So that, my Lord, the whole courſe of my Plea is this: 'Tis a hard caſe for a man after ſix years, to be indicted for a circumſtance of time. I will firſt offer the Teſtimony of one Witneſs that is dead, and that is Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> who at his death confirmed all that he had ſworn of the Popiſh Plot to be true, and affirmed that he had rather ſpoken leſs than the Truth than more; and for that I deſire that my Lord Keeper may be called, who took his dying Examination.</p>

                  <p>As for that, Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> it is a thing very well known to the world, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to a worthy Gentleman that ſits by you, (pointing to Mr. <hi>North</hi>) that Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> when he was ſick, did make ſome ſuch Proteſtation.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, I do finde theſe words in my Notes, that Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> ſhould ſay, about the latter end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>September;</hi> but I believe it was the latter end of <hi>Auguſt:</hi> Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> was at <hi>Harcourt</hi>'s Chamber, and being ask'd the queſtion by my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs,</hi> Whether he ſaid it poſitively, it was the latter end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> he ſaid it was in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> he would not be poſitive to a day, but he thought the latter end.</p>

                  <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis very well known that too, that <hi>Bedloe</hi> did ſwear <hi>Ireland</hi> was in Town the latter end of <hi>Auguſt</hi> or beginning of <hi>September,</hi> and to confirm it upon Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi>'s denial, you ſwore he was in Town the 1ſt or 2d of <hi>September,</hi> and gave you twenty ſhillings, that was the occaſion of your Oath.</p>

                  <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
                  <p>Then, my Lord, I deſire to call ſome Witneſſes to teſtifie to the Depoſition that was taken of Mr. <hi>Jenniſon,</hi> about <hi>Ireland</hi>'s being then in Town.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
                  <p>It was taken in year 79, by Sir <hi>Edmund Warcup.</hi>

                  <p>My Lord, I will then produce what he ſwore at another Tryal.</p>

                  <speaker>Oates.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, It has coſt me a great deal of money to ſearch him out; but I cannot any where meet with him, and that makes my caſe ſo much the harder; that I cannot when I have done all that man can do, get my Witneſſes together. I ſent in the depth of Winter for him, when I thought my Tryal would have come on before; but I could never hear of him.</p>

                  <p>No Sir, the Ticket of your <hi>Subpoena</hi> did onely mention <hi>Ireland, Whitebread</hi> and <hi>Langhorn</hi>'s Tryals. But I did formerly upon another occaſion look for the Tryal of Sir <hi>George Wakeman,</hi> but could not find it among all my Notes.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>Truly, my Lord, I can never truſt my memory at all when I take Notes, and it is now ſo long ſince that Tryal, that I dare not undertake to ſay I remember any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of it.</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Jenniſon</hi> was uſed as a VVitneſs in the Tryal of Sir <hi>George Wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and ſo was Mr. <hi>Bowes,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> who was produc'd to prove the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of Mr. <hi>Jenniſon</hi>'s Evidence: But, my Lord, ſince I cannot have the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:178846:22"/> of his Evidence, nor of <hi>Sarah Paines,</hi> I muſt only ſum up all I have to ſay in two or three words: My Lord, beſides that what I did deliver in Evidence at thoſe Tryals, I gave in upon Oath: you have Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi>'s Evidence at the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of <hi>Ireland</hi> teſtified by Mr. <hi>Blayney;</hi> and the teſtimony of him as a dying man, given into my now Lord Keeper, wherein he averr'd, That what he had ſpoken of the Plot, was all true: And you hear that he ſwore Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> was here in Town in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and ſo did <hi>Sarah Paine</hi> too; and I think upon my ſelf as very hardly uſed, to have ſuch a part of my Teſtimony brought in queſtion, after Witneſſes are dead, or gone out of the way. As for Mr. <hi>Jenniſon,</hi> his Evidence was formerly made uſe of; and his Evidence was approved of too, as is well known to thoſe that ſate Judges upon the late Viſcount <hi>Stafford.</hi> But this is that, my Lord, I muſt needs ſay for my ſelf, That as I hope to ſee the day of Salvation in another world, whatever I have ſworn about Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi>'s being here in Town betwixt the Eighth and Twelfth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 78, and in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>September,</hi> is true, as I ſhall anſwer it before God another day. And, my Lord, as to the Evidence this day brought againſt me, I deſire you would but obſerve, though that there are many of thoſe Witneſſes, yet a great part of them do not come up to the Eighth or Twelfth of <hi>Auguſt:</hi> and I hope your Lordſhip will remember and remark to the Jury, what little Credit thoſe of them had that came to teſtifie in the behalf of Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> at his Tryal, and at the Five Jeſuits Tryals, of which there are two Records before you; and they do firſt juſtifie this, That <hi>Ireland</hi> and the reſt of them were Guilty of what they were accuſed of; and then, That theſe Witneſſes did not teſtifie the Truth.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe two Tryals, my Lord, you have a third Verdict, and that is at the Tryal of Mr. <hi>Langhorn:</hi> Now the whole Popiſh Plot almoſt was laid forth in thoſe three Tryals; and, my Lord, I believe verily I am the firſt Precedent in all <hi>England,</hi> of any ones being Indicted for Perjury that was a Witneſs for the King in ſuch a Caſe as this, after ſix years time elapſed, after Verdict upon Verdict, and Judgment and Execution upon theſe Verdicts, and when no new Objection is now offered, but what was then ſtarted; and no new circumſtance occurs now, but was as forcible then, except it be the change of the Seaſon. And I deſire it may be conſidered, when all the Judges of <hi>England</hi> were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> at thoſe Tryals, theſe matters were fully diſcuſſed and debated; and then they did look upon all the Objections as fully anſwered and confuted.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, I am confident if I had been a Witneſs in any other Cauſe than of a Conſpiracy of the Papiſts, I might have had fairer quarter than I have now: And I do verily believe, that at this rate, it is more ſafe for Papiſts to be Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, than for any Proteſtant to diſcover a Popiſh Plot.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I beſeech you to take my Caſe into your ſerious Conſideration, as to the hardſhip of it; and ſince all my Witneſſes are in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces unknown, or they are ſuch as, conſidering the Times, dare not appear, ſome of them being Lawyers, and under fear they ſhall fare the worſe in their Practiſe; and others being perſons that depend upon the Law, and think they ſhall be lookt ill upon, as I am now lookt upon with a hard eye by the Popiſh party and their Adherents: Yet I hope you that are ſworn to do Juſtice, will not let me be ruined by a number of falſe Witneſſes, by the Evidence of Papiſts that are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. For if your Lordſhip pleaſe to conſider that Vote of the Lords Houſe, which is a Court of Record, wherein they do declare that they are fully ſatisfied by the proofs they have heard, that there then was, and for divers years <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> had been, a Horrid and Treaſonable Plot and Conſpiracy, contrived and carryed on by thoſe of the Popiſh Religion, for the murdering of his Majeſties Sacred Perſon, and for ſubverting the Proteſtant Religion, and the Ancient and Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Government of this Kingdom: which Vote of Parliament, my Lord,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:178846:22"/> does make the Papiſts to be all Parties in this Caſe, and where they are Parties, I hope they ſhall not be admitted as Evidence, or at leaſt not be believed, becauſe there is a turn to be ſerved by them againſt me, and a revenge they are reſolved to take upon me; for they have hopes now of bringing in their Religion, and are to welcome that in with my Ruine; and this is the cauſe of this proſecution: Their eyes do ſee now what their hearts ſo long deſired, that is, the death of a Great man who died but lately, and againſt whoſe Life they had conſpired ſo often and ſo long. My Lord, if this had been the firſt Conſpiracy that ever the Papiſts were guilty of, there might have been ſome more ſcruple and objection in the caſe: But if you caſt your eyes upon <hi>Campian</hi> and others in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, of <hi>Garnet</hi> and the Powder-Jeſuits in King <hi>James</hi>'s time, and the deſigns of the Popiſh party in the time of the late King <hi>Charles,</hi> the firſt diſcovered to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> If theſe things do paſs for Truth, and there is no Averment againſt ſo many Records as we have of their Conſpiracies, then my Diſcovery is no ſuch improbable a thing; and I hope then the Gentlemen of the Jury will take it into their conſiderations, who they are that are Witneſſes in this caſe; men whoſe very Religion is Rebellion, and whoſe Principles and Practiſes are pernicious to the Government; and thereby they are to be lookt upon as dangerous perſons in Church and State. But, my Lord, if the Letters of <hi>Coleman</hi> be well conſidered, they will juſtifie me that he Correſponded with <hi>Le Cheeſe</hi> the French Kings Confeſſour, for the promoting of Popery in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> is notorious to all mankind that have either read or heard that Tryal: Your Lordſhip was of Council for the King in that caſe, and heard how it was opened and plainly proved upon him: And when his Letters have been made ſo publick, and proved under his own hand, nay and confeſſed by himſelf, I think no man will doubt but that muſt be a plain proof of the Plot, and will be enough to vindicate me.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, I have one word more and then I have done, and leave it to your Lordſhip and the Jury. My Lord, as they would now fling the Popiſh Plot upon me, ſo there is an evident deſign to fling the Murder of <hi>Godfrey</hi> upon a Proteſtant Peer; and becauſe an Indictment was upon the Teſtimony of the Traytor <hi>Fitz-harris,</hi> againſt that noble Lord, they have reſolved to have profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Villains to take his Life for that Murder: that is apparent; and ſo they will go on ſtep by ſtep, if they be let alone; and think at length to wipe their mouths with <hi>Solomons</hi> Whore, and ſay, They have done no miſchief. My Lord, I leave theſe things to the Conſideration of the Court and Jury; I will not detain you any longer: I have called what Witneſſes a could get, but the diſtance of time has made it impoſſible for me to have thoſe here now, that did give Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in this matter before.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, I have one favour to beg of the Court, I had but a bad night laſt night, and am now in great pain; I deſire that you would grant me one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, that I may have Council aſſigned me to argue the Errours in yeſterdays Indictment: my Lord, I am but a poor man, and cannot be at the charges of fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Councel.</p>

                  <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the Queſtion that you are to try, is a Perjury, which is charged on the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant <hi>Titus Oates,</hi> for ſwearing that <hi>William Ireland</hi> was in Town, upon the firſt or ſecond of <hi>September</hi> 78. And likewiſe, for ſwearing that he took his leave of him at his Chamber in <hi>Ruſſel-ſtreet,</hi> between the eighth and twelfth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 78. And we do aſſigne the Perjury in both thoſe points, that he is forſworn in both, and the Evidence of that Perjury is, that it is impoſſible to be true, what <hi>Oates</hi> did ſwear, becauſe Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> was not in Town be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the eighth and twelfth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> nor the firſt or ſecond of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, You have heard the Evidence that has been given, and there has been no leſs than between forty and fifty Witneſſes produced to ſhow that it is really impoſſible what <hi>Oates</hi> did ſwear ſhould be true; he tells you that this matter is in a circumſtance of Time, wherein it is difficult for a man to be poſitive to a day, and a man may be allowed ſome Latitude in ſuch a Caſe; Nay, it is uſual with Witneſſes in points of time, to ſwear with a Latitude, but, my Lord, to ſhow that, if we ſhould grant that falſe Doctrine to be true (and falſe moſt certain it is, and of miſchievous conſequence it would be, if when things are charged upon men, that depend upon circumſtance of Time and Place, the Witneſſes ſhould not be ſtrictly kept to thoſe circumſtances) yet, I ſay, granting that Poſition, it is impoſſible it ſhould do him any ſervice in the Caſe before you: For between the beginning of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and the fourteenth of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> (which includes both the times he ſwears to, and the Latitude of above twenty days to boot) there is not any one moment of time wherein his Oath could be true.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, you obſerve what the Witneſſes have ſaid, how they have given you an account of every particular day of both months, from the third of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> when he firſt left <hi>London,</hi> to the fourteenth of <hi>September,</hi> when he returned back again: we did ask the Witneſſes, that it might appear to be plainly true, what they ſwear, if they had any particular circumſtances that made them to remember it; and they have given a great many, and now it lies upon us, to ſhow you that it is demonſtration, that what they have ſaid and teſtified muſt be true; and that thoſe days they ſpeak of, he was in the places they named.</p>
                  <p>For take the Periods of Time, and you will find you have him from the third of <hi>Auguſt</hi> to the ſixteenth, with my Lord <hi>Aſton,</hi> going from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Tixhall,</hi> upon the ſeventeenth they give you an account of him at Mrs. <hi>Harwell's</hi> to the twenty ſixth, from the twenty ſixth to the fourth of <hi>September.</hi> There are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that give you a particular account, by remarkable circumſtances, where he was every day in <hi>Stafford-ſhire,</hi> from the fourth to the ſeventh, you find him at <hi>Wolver-Hampton;</hi> for the eighth indeed we do give no particular account where he was that day; but we prove that upon the ninth he was at <hi>Tixhal,</hi> and from thence he came away with Sir <hi>John Southcoat</hi> towards <hi>London,</hi> and there you have a particular account where he was every day, till the fourteenth, when he returned to his Lodging.</p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:178846:23"/>
                  <p>And now <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> I ſhall ſhew you, that, if you believe theſe Witneſſes ſaw him in theſe Months; that certainly, it was upon thoſe dayes they ſpeak of, that they did ſee him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That he went out of Town in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> You have theſe Witneſſes, <hi>Anne Ireland, Eleanor Ireland,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Duddle,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Quino,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Aſton.</hi> Well, How come they to remember it was upon the Third of <hi>Auguſt?</hi> Why the four Women remembers it by this particular Remark; Three dayes before, there was a <hi>Holy-Day,</hi> which they keep in memory of <hi>Ignatius;</hi> and upon that day, they remember Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> went abroad to take a Recreation, and came home again that night, tho' the reſt of the Company ſtayed there; becauſe he was to go out of Town. Upon the Third day after, which muſt be the Third of <hi>Auguſt:</hi> For <hi>Ignatius</hi> day you hear, is alwayes the laſt day of <hi>July.</hi> And they do poſitively ſwear, that upon the Third of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> he took his leave of <hi>Anne Ireland</hi> and <hi>Eleanor Ireland.</hi> Mrs. <hi>Duddle</hi> Remembers, That he went out that day. Mrs. <hi>Quino,</hi> whoſe Husband was his <hi>Taylor,</hi> ſayes, he did ſtay a little to have ſomewhat in his Cloaths mended: And ſhe ſaw him in his Boots; and he ſaid he was to go out of Town. Mrs. <hi>Anne Ireland</hi> ſaies, They took the liberty to Lodg a Gentlewoman in his Chamber, and ſaw him not again, tell a fortnight before <hi>Michaelmas:</hi> And that he did go out of Town upon the Third of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> is further prov'd by my Lord <hi>Aſton,</hi> who noted it down in his Book at that time that <hi>Ireland</hi> came to his Houſe at <hi>Standen</hi> in <hi>Hartfordſhire:</hi> ſo that here is as ſtrong an Evidence as can be; that he did go on the Third of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and that they remember it to have ſo been by all the Circumſtances that can be imagin'd.</p>
                  <p>Well, the Third of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> he went out of Town. The Fourth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> we give an account where he was: He ſtayed that day with my Lord <hi>Aston</hi> at <hi>Standen.</hi> The Fifth of <hi>August,</hi> he ſet out with my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s Company, and went to St. <hi>Albans.</hi> The Sixth, he went to <hi>Northampton.</hi> The Seventh to <hi>Coventry.</hi> The Eighth to <hi>Tixhall,</hi> and the Company that went with him proves it; which was Sir <hi>Edward Southcoat,</hi> and Mr. <hi>John Southcoat;</hi> and <hi>Harriſon</hi> and <hi>Hobſon,</hi> who ſaw him go in the Company, and Mr. <hi>North,</hi> who ſaies, he ſaw him every day; and <hi>Ingletrap</hi> the Coachman that drove the Coach, all theſe remembers it poſitively; and ſome of them ſpeak of a remarkable pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Horſe which he rid upon.</p>
                  <p>Now when he comes from <hi>Tixhall;</hi> (for we have brought him hither by manifeſt proof, by men that could not forget; by men that ſaw him in the Company): There he remained (as they all teſtifie) till the Thirteenth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and that was the <hi>Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> after his Arrival at <hi>Tixhall;</hi> and from thence he went that day a Journey into <hi>Flintſhire</hi> to <hi>Holy-Well;</hi> and that is proved by the Witneſſes that were in his Company in that Journey. They tell you the Thirteenth he lay at <hi>Nantwich.</hi> The Fourteenth at <hi>Holy-Well.</hi> The Fifteenth at <hi>Cheſter.</hi> And the Sixteenth he came back again to <hi>Tixhall.</hi> And ſo here you have abundance of Witneſſes, that give you a particular account where he was, in what Company they ſay him from the Third of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> to the Sixteenth. If he were then in this Company from the Third to the Sixteenth; he could not be in his Chamber in <hi>Ruſſel-St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>t,</hi> between the Eighth and the Twelfth.</p>
                  <p>Then we came to the Seventeenth, and then we find him to be at <hi>Wolverhampton,</hi> where he continued to the Twenty-ſixth; and that it muſt be between the Seventeenth and the Twenty-ſixth, is plain; For after that time which Mrs. <hi>Harwell</hi> ſpeaks of, the other Witneſſes gives ſuch Circumſtances, that it cannot be otherwiſe: You find him on the Twenty-ſeventh, at a Horſe-Race, which is a remarkable Circumſtance. And theſe are things that men do very well remember what dayes of the month they happen upon. We then give you an account of the Twenty-nineth; that at <hi>Tixhall</hi> he was ſeen in Company upon the Bowling-Green, with Perſons of Quality; Sir <hi>Thomas Whitegrave</hi> and others. So we give you an account where he Lodged. The Twenty-eighth he was at <hi>Bellamore;</hi> the Twenty-nineth, he went to Mr. <hi>Hereninghams:</hi> there he Lodged till the Firſt of <hi>September;</hi> and this is remembred by particular Circumſtances, that he went a <hi>Fiſhing,</hi> and a <hi>Setting,</hi> and a <hi>Hunting:</hi> Then the next day, which is the Firſt of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember;</hi> and the next day after, the Second of <hi>September,</hi> they ſaw him at Mr. <hi>Gerrards,</hi> he din'd upon the Second at Mrs. <hi>Cromptons,</hi> and lay at <hi>Boſcobel;</hi> there he continued the Third, and the Fourth he came to <hi>Wolverhampton</hi> again.</p>
                  <p>So that this ſhewes, that what Mrs. <hi>Harwell</hi> did ſpeak of, was true; for, if Mrs. <hi>Harwell</hi> did ſee him, as 'tis not at all doubted, but ſhe did: It muſt be in that interval of time between the Sixteenth and the Twenty-ſeventh; where we give you an account of him by other undeniable Circumſtances, that he Lodged at other places, and could not Lodge at her Houſe in <hi>Wolverhampton.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:178846:24"/>
                  <p>Beſides, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> the particular Circumſtances that they do remember him by, proves it to be on thoſe Days. Mrs. <hi>Harwell</hi> gives her poſitive Oath, That he did come there the Seventeenth, and lay there every Night to the Twenty ſixth, which was on the <hi>Monday</hi> Seven-night after; and that he came again the Fourth of <hi>September</hi> after, and lay there till the Seventh.</p>
                  <p>Then there is <hi>Ruſhton,</hi> another Witneſs, that ſaw him at her Houſe, the Eighteenth, Nineteenth, Twentieth, Twenty firſt, Twenty ſecond, and Twenty fifth: And, I ſay, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> muſt be thoſe Days, becauſe we have given an Account, by other Witneſſes, of all the other Days. And it muſt be that very Time, that <hi>Oats</hi> ſpeaks of: For it was the <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> before <hi>Ireland</hi> was Apprehended and Executed for the <hi>Plot,</hi> which was <hi>Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> 1678.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. <hi>Winford</hi> ſhe remembers him at <hi>Wolverhampton</hi> the Eighteenth, Ninteenth, Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſecond, and Twenty fourth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Stanley</hi> remembers the Eighteenth and Ninteenth: And if you ask him, How he remembers it? He tells you by a Circumſtance, that moſt Men would remember; He buried his Child that Day, and entertain'd <hi>Ireland</hi> with the Proviſion for the Funeral. Now, Men uſually remark ſuch Accidents as theſe; for that is a thing a Man cannot forget, that has any Concern in the World, for thoſe that are ſo nearly related to him. And therefore ſuch Circumſtances muſt of neceſſity evince the Truth of what he ſpeaks; becauſe it is brought to his Mind by an Accident, that cannot be forgotten.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. <hi>Purcel,</hi> which is the next Witneſs: And ſhe remembers to have ſeen him the Eighteenth, Ninteenth, Twentieth, Twenty firſt, Twenty ſecond, and Twenty third; for ſhe remembers the laſt of them, was the Day before <hi>Bartholomew</hi>-Day; which was a remarkable Day.</p>
                  <p>Then there is another Man, that look't to his Horſe whil'ſt he was there; but his Memory will not ſerve him to ſpeak to any particular Time: He only evidences, that he was there; and the other Witneſſes ſpeak to the Time.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Stamford,</hi> he remembers it to be at that Time, becauſe he ſaw him on the <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> after the <hi>Aſſumption of our Lady;</hi> which is always the Fifteenth of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> And the like ſays Mrs. <hi>Gifford.</hi> Theſe Circumſtances verifies her Teſtimony.</p>
                  <p>And Mr. <hi>Gifford</hi> remembers, he came on the Seventeenth Day: And he ſaw him every Day, till the Twenty ſixth Day.</p>
                  <p>And Mrs. <hi>Fowler,</hi> who is Mrs. <hi>Harwell</hi>'s Daughter: She remembers, he came the Seventeenth Day; and ſhe was in his Company every Day, till the Twenty ſixth; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept one Day, when he went to <hi>Litchfield;</hi> that was the Day before <hi>Bartholomew</hi>-Day, which was <hi>Fryday.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mrs. <hi>Keeling,</hi> ſhe ſwears, That upon the Seventeenth Day he came there, which was <hi>Saturday.</hi> She ſaw him on the <hi>Sunday,</hi> and on the <hi>Monday;</hi> and went on the <hi>Monday</hi> in the Afternoon, to the Funeral of her Mother: Which is another Circumſtance, that ſhe muſt needs remember; and by that, has the Remembrance of the Day of the Month when he was there: And ſhe return'd back again on <hi>Thurſday,</hi> and heard him that Day, but did not ſee him. But ſhe ſaw him every Day after, till he went away: And ſhe remembers his going away was upon the Twenty ſeventh. And ſhe remembers like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that he return'd the Fourth of <hi>September</hi> after.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Richardſon</hi> he proves, That he ſaw him upon the Ninteenth Day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> at <hi>Wolverhampton;</hi> as he was told, It was he: And being ask't, When he was told ſo? He ſays, Mrs. <hi>Harwell</hi> told him ſo ſometime before he was Apprehended. So that, ſhe could not tell it him then, to ſerve a turn. And he is a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> too.</p>
                  <p>So is likewiſe <hi>Eleanor Graves:</hi> Who gives you an Account, that ſhe ſaw him there on the Twentieth, Twenty firſt, and Twenty ſecond; and on the Twenty third, ſhe went to <hi>Litchfield</hi> with him: And upon the Twenty fifth, ſhe ſupp'd with him at Mr. <hi>Winford</hi>'s.</p>
                  <p>Now, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> you have a full Account of it, even to a Demonſtration, That he muſt be in theſe Places at this Time, if you will believe one thing; that is, That theſe Witneſſes ſaw him at all: And ſure, none can doubt, but theſe Witneſſes did, upon the Circumſtances they have teſtified, ſee him in <hi>Auguſt</hi> and <hi>September.</hi> And then it muſt be thoſe particular Times, that they ſpeak of.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Wolverhampton,</hi> then, you have him to the Twenty ſixth: The Twenty ſeventh Day, you have an Account of him at the Horſe Race at <hi>Etchin-Hill.</hi> The Twenty eighth, Mr. <hi>Howard</hi> gives you an Account, he din'd at at <hi>Bellamore,</hi> at Mr. <hi>Aſton</hi>'s. The Twenty ninth, you find him at the <hi>Bowling-green</hi> at <hi>Tixhall:</hi> And from thence to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:178846:24"/> Mr. <hi>Hereningham</hi>'s; where he lodg'd that Night, and ſtay'd there the Thirtieth: Which is prov'd by the Circumſtances of Fiſhing in the Morning, and Setting in the Afternoon. And the next Day, which was <hi>Saturday</hi> the Thirty firſt, you hear he was at the Killing of a <hi>Buck;</hi> where Mr. <hi>Gerrard</hi> was expected, but Sickneſs prevented his coming. And you have him the Firſt of <hi>September,</hi> which was <hi>Sunday,</hi> at Mr. <hi>Gerrard</hi>'s Houſe, where ſeveral of the Witneſſes did ſee him.</p>
                  <p>And beſides, one <hi>Proctor</hi> tells you, He ſaw him the Thirty firſt of <hi>August,</hi> at <hi>Fulford,</hi> at Mr. <hi>Lowe</hi>'s. And he very well remembers that to be the Time, by a remarkable Circumſtance: <hi>For</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the laſt Day of</hi> Auguſt <hi>I went to pay ſome Money,</hi> (which is a thing Men are generally very punctual in) <hi>and when I came Home again, I found him there.</hi> And he ſwears, he ſaw him at Mr. <hi>Gerrard</hi>'s Houſe, the Firſt of <hi>September,</hi> the Day after.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>King</hi> remembers, he ſaw him at Mr. <hi>Gerrard</hi>'s of <hi>Hilderſhame,</hi> the Firſt of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember;</hi> and that he din'd at Mrs. <hi>Crompton</hi>'s, the Second of <hi>September;</hi> and ſtay'd there till Two of the Clock in the Afternoon: And went from thence, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to go to <hi>Boſcobell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lee</hi> ſays, He ſaw him at Mr. <hi>Gerrard</hi>'s Houſe, and at Mrs. <hi>Crompton</hi>'s: That he din'd there, and went from thence to <hi>Pancraſs,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Boſcobell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Biddulph</hi> remembers, he din'd with him on the Second of <hi>September,</hi> at his Aunts; and that by this Circumſtance, He was deſir'd by my Lord <hi>Cullen,</hi> to ſee an Horſe-Race in <hi>Northamptonſhire;</hi> and promiſed my Lord <hi>Cullen</hi> to come: Which Horſe-Race is always on a certain day, the Firſt <hi>Thurſday</hi> in <hi>September;</hi> and that Year it happen'd to be the Fifth of <hi>September:</hi> And it was the <hi>Monday</hi> before, that he din'd at his Aunts. And becauſe of his Promiſe to my Lord <hi>Cullen,</hi> he would not ſtay all Night. And ſo it muſt be the Second day of <hi>September,</hi> that he ſaw him there.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. <hi>Crompton</hi> ſays, It was the ſame day, that her Nephew, Mr. <hi>Biddulph,</hi> din'd there: For he was a Stranger, and ſhe never ſaw him before, nor after.</p>
                  <p>And there is another Gentlewoman, Mrs. <hi>Palmer,</hi> that ſwears, He din'd at Mrs. <hi>Cromp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s; but ſhe cannot tell the particular Time when.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. <hi>Gifford</hi> ſaw him at <hi>Pancraſs,</hi> between the Hours of Four and Five in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, upon the Second of <hi>September:</hi> And <hi>Lee</hi> went along with him to <hi>Pancraſs;</hi> and from thence he went to <hi>Boſcobell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Pendrell</hi> ſays, He ſaw him the Second of <hi>September</hi> at Night: For he came to his Houſe. Which agrees with all that the other Witneſſes ſay, which was, That he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to go to <hi>Boſcobell</hi> that Night. He and his Wife both teſtifie, That there he lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Second of <hi>September;</hi> and ſtay'd there the Third of <hi>September;</hi> and went from thence, the Fourth, to <hi>Black-Ladies:</hi> Where Mr. <hi>Gifford</hi> tells you, he din'd.</p>
                  <p>And we have given you an Account before, where he was the Fourth at Night: For then he was return'd to <hi>Wolverhampton;</hi> and there he lodg'd to the Seventh of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi> And after the Seventh of <hi>September,</hi> though we do not give you a poſitive Evidence, That upon the Seventh of <hi>September,</hi> at Night, or upon the Eighth, he was at my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s: Yet we have given you that, which amounts almoſt to a Demonſtration, That he muſt be there upon the Eighth of <hi>September.</hi> For he went from thence with Sir <hi>John Southcoat,</hi> to go towards <hi>London,</hi> on the Ninth. And our Evidence is the more Credible, becauſe they ſwear cautiouſly all of them: Unleſs they remember ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Circumſtance, they will not take upon them to fix upon a particular time.</p>
                  <p>Then, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> we give you an Account, by the Perſons that were in his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, where he was every day, all along from the time he left <hi>Tixhall,</hi> down to the time he came to Sir <hi>John Southcoat</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>Surry.</hi> And this Journey took up the Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh and Twelfth of <hi>September:</hi> There are Four days; and he ſtay'd there one day. Then he ſold Mr. <hi>Southcoat</hi> his Horſe. Mr. <hi>Southcoat</hi> lent him his Horſe, to come to Town; and the next day he did come to Town. And ſo we have brought him to <hi>Saturday</hi> the Fourteenth of <hi>September.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now, let all the World be judge, if there be any poſſible Room left, that any one Word Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> has ſaid, can be true; even giving him the Latitude of Time, that he himſelf deſires, and ſays, All Witneſſes muſt be allow'd? No, there is not one Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute for him, wherein he can be verified in any one Tittle of his Evidence, as to <hi>Ireland</hi>'s being in Town. And this is that which I call, (and ſure, well I may ſo call it) a <hi>Demonſtrative Proof,</hi> That what <hi>Oats</hi> did ſwear, is utterly falſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> The <hi>Jury</hi> had not this Evidence at the Tryal of <hi>Ireland:</hi> Some they were, that went out of the Town with him; and ſome, One or Two, of <hi>Wolverhampton,</hi> were
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:178846:25"/> at the Five <hi>Jeſuites</hi> Tryals; but not above Five or Six in all of theſe Forty odd, that now appears. True indeed it is, all theſe were not there; and <hi>Ireland,</hi> upon that, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately ſuffer'd; for ſo I may take Leave to ſay, It was <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfortunately.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> has ſaid one thing unto you, which he lays much ſtreſs upon: He would have you look upon it as a great hardſhip, That this Proſecution comes ſo late; and that it is ſtrange, after Six Years time ſpent, this ſhould not be ſet on foot.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> I cannot but with much ſorrow remember to you; and I know you all remember it too well: That there was a time, when the City of <hi>London</hi> was ſo far Corrupted, that it was become a Refuge and Sanctuary for High-Treaſon; when there was no Juſtice to be had for the King there; when men Lodged themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thoſe Walls, as a Protection for their Conſpiracies; we all remember the time, when Indictments were preferr'd, and a plain evidence given to a <hi>Grand Jury,</hi> even to the Publick Satisfaction of all that heard it; and yet they have refuſed to find the Bill: And not only ſo, but were ſo abetted by the Rabble, that it was ſcarce ſafe for the Judges to ſit upon the Bench. Theſe are things none of us can forget, but muſt be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally remembred, to the ſhame of the Authors and Contrivers of them: And therefore it is no wonder an Indictment was not preferr'd againſt Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> at that time, when the plaineſt proof againſt <hi>Criminals,</hi> could not be admitted. And this will give every man ſatisfaction, why it has been delayed. And <hi>I</hi> hope at the ſame time give every man a Caution, how they fall into the like Circumſtances again.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> You have heard the Evidence that is now offered, to prove this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact; and it is a plain demonſtration, if you will believe that Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> was ſeen by theſe men at all, he was ſeen at thoſe very times they have particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared: For upon conſideration of the Circumſtances, it is impoſſible it ſhould be at any other times; and ſo <hi>I</hi> leave it to you to judge upon the whole, whether the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant</hi> be Perjured or no.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of the <hi>Jury,</hi> this Caſe has taken up a great deal of time; but it is a Caſe of that Moment and Conſequence, that ſure no time ought to be thought too long, that is employed for the diſcovering of the Truth, ſo neceſſary to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd, as the matter now in queſtion. For as <hi>I</hi> ſaid at the beginning upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and <hi>I</hi> cannot but ſay it again now; <hi>I</hi> confeſs <hi>I</hi> cannot without Horror and Trembling, Reflect upon the many miſchiefs and inconveniencies we have been run into, if the Teſtimony given this day in this Cauſe againſt <hi>Oats</hi> prove true, as <hi>I</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in the leaſt imagine, where there ſhould remain the leaſt objection againſt the Truth of it; <hi>I</hi> cannot, <hi>I</hi> ſay, but bewail, that ſo many innocent Perſons (to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of our Nation be it ſpoken) have ſuffered death upon this account.</p>
                  <p>God deliver me from having the leaſt ſtain of <hi>Innocent Blood</hi> imputed to me; and it is more to be Lamented, when we ſee that impudence, which has brought that Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my upon our Land, continues with a Brazen-Face, defying all ſhame to this day. But by this we may be informed, how ſome mens Conſciences are ſeared, and that there are ſome people that do indeed Live without the fear of God in the World. For if that man, who has aſſumed to himſelf the Habit and Character of one that ſhould Preach to others, Religion, Vertue, and the things that become true Chriſtians, ſhall become ſuch a <hi>Monſter</hi> of Impiety and Impudence, in defiance of Heaven and Earth; What greater and more manifeſt proof can there be of a ſeared Conſcience!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> cannot but lament likewiſe the wickedneſs of our Age, when <hi>I</hi> reflect upon the Teſtimony of that other Wretch (indeed <hi>I</hi> cannot uſe terms ſevere enough for him) that when he was going into another World, ſhould Preſiſt in ſuch groſs Falſities; <hi>I</hi> mean <hi>Bedloe,</hi> Infamous <hi>Bealoe;</hi> and let his name be for ever Infamous to all Mankind, that have any regard, or deferance for the Truth; that he ſhould with his lateſt Breath dare to affirm, That every Word he had ſaid of the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> was true; when it is as clear as the Sun, by the Teſtimony of this day; that every word he ſwore about <hi>Ireland,</hi> was utterly falſe. <hi>Good God of Heaven! What an Age have we liv'd in, to ſee Innocence ſuffer Puniſhment, and Impudent falſity Reign ſo long.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> I hope all Eyes are opened (I wiſh they had been ſo long ſince;) let us lay the Burden, the Infamy and Reproach of theſe things, upon them that deſerve it; for we cannot but know we are reckoned as a by-word to all our Neighbours, and ſhall remain Monuments of Ignominy to all ſucceeding Ages and Times, if we did not endeavour to diſcharge our ſelves, and our Religion, and the Juſtice of our Nation from theſe Scandals.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> I think I am obliged, in the Firſt place, to take notice of what Mr. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciter
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:178846:25"/> General</hi> has mentioned, concerning the Inſolency of thoſe times; wherein the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was grown to that extravagant Height, that, in truth, a man durſt not appear, with ſafety of his own Life and Fortune, to Teſtify the Truth. And, Is it not a ſhame, that it ſhould be remembred, what one of the Witneſſes this day Teſtified? That when he came to appear at the Council-Table, to Atteſt a Matter of Fact, before this Innocent Blood was ſpilt (for ſo I muſt call it, if that which has been Sworn this day is true) the Rabble ſhould be ſo boiſterous, as to cry out; <hi>Where is that Villain, that dares come to give Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt</hi> Oats, <hi>the <hi>Saviour of the Nation?</hi>
                     </hi> Oh, horrid Blaſphemy, that no leſs an Epethite ſhould be given to ſuch a Profligate Wretch as <hi>Oats,</hi> than that which is only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to our Bleſſed LORD! As though <hi>Oats</hi> had merited more than all mankind; and ſo indeed he has, if we take it in a true Senſe: He has deſerved much more Puniſhment, than the Laws of this Land can inflict.</p>
                  <p>And I muſt needs ſay, Gentlemen, That this is an Inſtance, why there ſeems not to have been Puniſhment enough ordain'd in Law for Perjury; becauſe our Law-makers did not foreſee, that there could ever be ſuch Villains, ſuch Miſcreants, as theſe.</p>
                  <p>We have indeed another Inſtance in the Law, of a Crime for which there is no ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate Puniſhment; and that is in the Caſe, where a Child kills his Father; Paricide has no peculiar Judgment aſſigned for it; but we are forc't, becauſe theſe things have been ſometimes practiſed, by a Conſtruction in Law, to make that Child as a Servant to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo Puniſh him with the Judgment of Petty-Treaſon; but take him immediately, as he is a Child, and not as a Servant, and I ſay, there is no particular Proviſion in Law, to Puniſh ſuch an Offence: And, What is the Reaſon of it? Becauſe it is ſo unnatural, and againſt the Imaginations of Man-kind to believe, there ever could be ſuch a wicked Child in the World.</p>
                  <p>If that be not to be Imagin'd, How could it be Imagin'd, that there ſhould ever be ſuch horrid Villains, as ſhould attempt the Deſtruction of the Government of <hi>Three</hi> Kingdoms? Good Lord! What Times do we live in? Surely, 'tis ſuch an Age, as was never known, from the Creation of the World, to this day.</p>
                  <p>And to this muſt be added, what aggravates the Miſchief, That all this is done under the Umbrage, Countenance, and Pretence of Law; the Proceedings of Law, the uſual Methods of Juſtice, are made the Inſtruments of the moſt horrid Injuſtice. The Murder of our late Bleſſed Sovereign, King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the Martyr, of ever happy Memory, though a Crime as high in it ſelf, as the Law knows of; yet I may ſay, it was aggravated ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much, that that Unfortunate, but Glorious King, ſhould be brought to the Block, by a Pretext of Law, and Cut off by a colourable Method of Juſtice; 'Tis that which makes that Murder ten times more Baſe and Infamous. So, Gentlemen, the deſtruction of poor innocent Perſons, by falſe Accuſations, by the pernicious Evidence of Perjur'd Witneſſes, in a Courſe of Juſtice, makes their Crime infinitely more odious, than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Murder.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, I cannot but ſpeak with warmth in a Caſe of this Nature; and I the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeak ſo, becauſe, at the time when thoſe Things were done, we all know, the Nation was in a Hurry, and a ſort of ill-minded Men had crept in among us, who had blown us up to ſuch an height, that nothing but what comply'd with their malicious and Devilliſh deſigns, was to be believed; when the King could not get common Juſtice done againſt real Traytors; but the very Streams of Juſtice were all Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, though the Fountain (God be thanked) was preſerved pure.</p>
                  <p>When the Faction (by Cabals and Intrigues) had got Sheriffs of their own Party, and laboured to get all other Officers of their own wicked Principles, then came all thoſe Miſchiefs we ſo long labour'd under. When thoſe Fellows, that had ſo great a ſhare in the late Rebellion, were the only fit Men to be truſted with the Government; and all the while were deſigning to deſtroy it, and to bring Us into the ſame miſerable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we formerly were in.</p>
                  <p>Was it ever (I ſpeak to you, Gentlemen of the Jury, Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> who know its antient Conſtitution, and have too well experienced its late Convulſions) was it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver known, till juſtice was deſigned to be Corrupted, that there was any Labouring to be Sheriffs? No, Endeavours were always uſed to be excuſed, and Fines paid to get off from that Office: And the Reaſon is plain, for never was there a wife and wealthy Citizen, that had a mind, out of a Principal part of his Eſtate, to ſquander away ſo much as is neceſſary to defray the Charge of that Office: But it was the Deſign that thoſe Raſcals had upon the Government, that made them ſo greedy of thoſe Places; and they thought they had now an opportunity to effect their Deſign, upon theſe Fellows
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:178846:26"/> Pretended Diſcovery. They believed, that becauſe we were hurried into the Miſchiefs of the late Times, by pretences of <hi>Popery,</hi> the ſame Bait would be ſwallowed now: Therefore, the Cry muſt be ſet up, <hi>Popery was a coming-in.</hi> They concluded, if they could but make uſe of the ſame Engines, they ſhould have the ſame Effect: Witneſs a Peer, that is now dead, one that was a main Inſtrument of our Confuſion in the late Times, and thereby experienc'd in Villainy, was made uſe of, as the Chief Tool in theſe late Contrivances.</p>
                  <p>But alas! When they found thoſe Pretences and Projects would take no longer, then they fly to that, which was indeed the bottom of All; I mean, <hi>The bloody Conſpiracy:</hi> When they found they could not overthrow the Government by Methods of Law, they betake themſelves to down-right Treaſon. For by this time, the Eyes of the honeſt Citizens were opened; and they found what Intereſt was driving on: And it was time to have them open, when a Cauſe in <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> was alwayes Tryed according to the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of the Clyent, and not the Merits of the Cauſe; when, if a Man was blaſted with the name of a <hi>Tory,</hi> he was ſure to Loſe it: But if a whining Raſcal was Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the name of a <hi>Whigg,</hi> he was ſure to have it go on his ſide: Witneſs the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Cauſe of Mr. <hi>Loades,</hi> about his <hi>Limons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But when Sheriffs came to be Elected in due manner, ſuch as were fit to be Truſted with the City-Buſineſs: What do they, but break out into a horrid Conſpiracy, to take away the Life of that bleſſed King, that merciful Prince, ſo lately deceaſed, to the Grief and Sorrow of all His loving and loyal Subjects: And not only ſo, but to rob us of His Sacred Majeſty, our preſent moſt Gracious Sovereign; whom I pray God to preſerve long to Reign over us. <hi>To which, the Auditory gave a great Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, ſaying,</hi> Amen.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, When theſe things are thought upon, you muſt give me leave to obſerve (let others think what they pleaſe) that was the real Plot, the true Plot: For there is one thing Obſervable, that attends this whole Affair, That every Man who Suffered for the Plot, which the Witneſſes truly call <hi>Oats</hi>'s Plot, to a Man denied it, even to the laſt Gaſp; and took it upon their Deaths and Salvations, that they were Innocent: Nay, when they had not thoſe hopes <hi>Bedloe</hi> had, of Life, (for I cannot believe, that he could have been ſo egregious a Villain, as to have Atteſted ſuch notorious Lies, if he had not hop'd to have Recovered; and thereby increaſed his own Reputation) yet not a Man of the others, but diſown'd it with their dying Breath. Now, on the other ſide, there was not a man, that was concern'd in the Conſpiracy, of which this was to be the blind and the colour, had the Conſidence to deny it, when they came to Suffer for it. All this ought to be put in the Ballance, and duly weighed.</p>
                  <p>For, Gentlemen, becauſe it is a Matter that is not only publick here, but all the World over, we muſt have the Juſtice of the Nation vindicated, and its diſ-reputation wiped off. And having taken Notice of theſe things, which I could not well omit upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I muſt now put you in mind, what is neceſſary for you to take into your Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to the particular Caſe before you. And,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> You muſt obſerve, That this Indictment againſt <hi>Oats,</hi> is for Committing wilful and corrupt Perjury; which is alſo laid to be done maliciouſly. And if it were Falſe, ſurely it was Malicious; becauſe, by his Falſe Oath, have Innocent men been Convicted, Condemned, and Executed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> You are to Conſider, how far the thing goes, to make it material to the Iſſue: For if it were upon a Nicety only, or a Catch, or any of thoſe fine Words, that he has been pleaſed to make uſe of; it were not fit to Perjure him upon it. But it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly very material: For Time and Place are matters Subſtantial to diſcover Truth and Falſhood by, as in the Caſe of <hi>Suſannah;</hi> The Perjury of the <hi>Elders,</hi> as you may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, was detected by thoſe very Circumſtances. But I ſhall ſhew you the occaſion of this Oath; and that will manifeſt it to be a Material part, in reſpect of the Time. For,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Here was a Conſult held, as he Teſtified, the 24th. of <hi>April,</hi> 1678, and then he Swears <hi>Ireland</hi> was in Town, and preſent at the Conſult: But all that <hi>Oats</hi> Swore, would not do the Feat, becauſe that he was but one Witneſs. Then comes <hi>Bedloe,</hi> his worthy Yoke-fellow (a brace of ſuch Witneſſes, as the Lord deliver all mankind from) and he Aſſigns another Fact upon Mr. <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the month of <hi>Augnſt,</hi> the latter end of it, or the beginning of <hi>September;</hi> which is material, and makes two Witneſſes againſt <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which <hi>Oats</hi> knew well enough: For he is his Arts-Maſter; he knows all the Tricks, and can tell the very Nick that will do. And therefore, when he finds Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> ſo poſitively Affirming, That he was then out of Town; and if ſo, <hi>Bedloe</hi> did not Swear
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:178846:26"/> true: Then does this <hi>Oats</hi> come in, (and thereby makes his Teſtimony material to the Point then in iſſue.) Says he, <hi>The Firſt of</hi> September, <hi>or (at leaſt) the Second, I will ſwear, he was in Town; for he gave me Twenty Shillings:</hi> And that is given as a Token, why he does remember it. And thus he did prop up <hi>Bedloe</hi>'s Teſtimony, againſt Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi>'s Defence. This is proved to you, by Mr. <hi>Waterhouſe,</hi> who was one of the <hi>Jury.</hi> And the ſame thing does the next Gentleman ſwear, which is Mr. <hi>Byfeild:</hi> They do both agree in that Circumſtance punctually, That he ſwore, he had then of him Twenty Shillings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ay,</hi> (but ſays he for himſelf, becauſe I would remove the Objections out of the way, as they occur to me) <hi>'tis very hard, this being now ſome ſix or ſeven Years ago, that I ſhould be called to queſtion about ſuch a thing; when they might have had a time to diſprove it before.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> the Anſwer that has been truly given to you, concerning the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerableneſs of the Times; when, the Truth of it is, there was no Juſtice to be had for <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> if we ſpeak of the <hi>Church-of-England-Men</hi> under that Name: For either they were <hi>Papiſts</hi> in Maſquerade, or <hi>Popiſhly</hi> affected; or the Names of <hi>Tory</hi> and <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivy,</hi> and I know not what, was enough to do their work for them: And no Body was reckoned of the Sober, Virtuous, Godly Party, but thoſe that were under <hi>Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and <hi>Covenants;</hi> as though there was no Sanctity to be found in any, but thoſe who were bent to deſtroy all Virtue and Religion. I ſay, Beſides that, there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Anſwer; which, I am ſorry, has ſo much weight in it: Could any Man have believed, that <hi>Oats</hi> ſhould dare ſo impudently to ſwear a Falſhood, and that in a Cauſe where Life was concern'd; and the Man-hang'd upon his Teſtimony? To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe then ſhould his Relations interpoſe to diſprove <hi>Oats,</hi> after his Death? That would not revive him. But you find, there was an Inclination that way; and I wiſh to <hi>God,</hi> with all my Heart, it had taken effect: For, What ſays the Old Gentlewoman? As ſoon as ſhe heard what Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> had ſworn, which ſhe knew to be falſe, immediately ſhe diſpatch't an Expreſs to <hi>London;</hi> and ſent a Petition to the King, <hi>That either</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>might have a new Tryal, or his Execution might be Repriev'd, till they brought up ſuch Witneſſes, as would have made it apparent, and as clear as the Light, That what this Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low had teſtified, was notoriouſly falſe.</hi> But ſuch, ſuch, I muſt ſay, was the Misfortune of the Time we were in, that ſtop't the Fountain of Mercy it ſelf, from letting forth its wonted Streams; and even compelled that Compaſſionate Prince, rather than he would give any Diſturbance to his People, to permit that Execution againſt his own Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; becauſe there was a Verdict, and Judgment in the Caſe. For, as he was really the Fountain of Juſtice; ſo was he of Mercy too. And it is well known to thoſe that had the Happineſs to be near his Perſon, how oft he expreſſed his Concern, for having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to this Execution. And this continued with him even to his dying Day, as the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of my Lord of <hi>Strafford</hi> did with his Royal Father.</p>
                  <p>And, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> I choſe to mention this Paſſage concerning his late Majeſty, for this Reaſon, That when we live in ſuch Tumultuous Times, when things are put ſo hard upon Princes, as to compel them to reſtrain their Mercy, where they think it due, rather than ſeem to ſtop the Currant of Juſtice; this ſhould not be remembred with any Reflection upon them, but with Infamy to thoſe that are the Cauſes and Grounds of it: When ſuch Prodigious Wretches, as <hi>Oats</hi> and <hi>Bedloe;</hi> for there appears no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence before you, but that of thoſe two proligate Villains, who came out of Goals: And after having been guilty of Villainies almoſt of all ſorts, that ever were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, came to be ſanctified by committing more. And were therefore called, <hi>The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours of the Nation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> The next Objection that is made againſt the Evidence for the King, is, <hi>That they are all Papiſts; who deſign nothing but to deſtroy the Government, and ruin the Proteſtant Religion.</hi> And this muſt be taken to be the whole Deſign of all theſe Perſons of Quality, and others, that they come to forſwear themſelves, and damn their Souls to all Eternity, on purpoſe only to deſtroy Innocent, Proteſtant Mr. <hi>Oats.</hi> Alack-a-day! When, at the ſame time, I muſt tell you, if it were neceſſary; You have about Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or Eight <hi>Proteſtant Witneſſes</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> that Confirm the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the reſt: Not that we muſt think, or ought to have any ſuch Conception among us, but that <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> in point of Law, are good Witneſſes; and are to be Credited as much as any other Witneſſes whatſoever, unleſs there be ſome Objection made to them, which would be the ſame againſt a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> as a <hi>Papiſt:</hi> For there remains a Right in them; and they ought to have equal Credit given to their Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:178846:27"/> with thoſe of any other perſwaſion, if a regular Objection be not ſtarted againſt them. And ſure I am, that has been alwayes the Law; and ſhall be my Practice, while I have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to do with the Adminiſtration of Juſtice. Let the ſober Party, as they call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, make what Reflections they pleaſe upon it, or trouble themſelves as they will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it; I value them not, nor their Opinion: Let them ſend as many <hi>Penny-Poſt</hi> Letters and Libels, as they have a mind to do; two of which I receiv'd laſt Night, about Yeſterdays Tryal. This I am ſure of, Lying is as much the Talent and Inclination of a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> as ever it can be of a <hi>Papiſt;</hi> Nay, more: For it is as inſeparably Incident to a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> (and ſuch ſnivling, whining, canting Knaves) to Lye, as to Speak. They can no more forbear Lying, than they can forbear Speaking; for generally, as often as they do the one, they do the other.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, I muſt Obſerve to you, with what caution, care, and ſobriety, both of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and Action, all theſe Gentlemen and Women have delivered their Teſtimony, with the greateſt tenderneſs and care, that poſſibly could be: And as well as they have given it with Caution; ſo I cannot but put it home to you, Gentlemen at the Bar, to give it its due Conſideration.</p>
                  <p>For though the other Juries did believe <hi>Oats,</hi> and not them at that time; yet that is not to be your meaſure, becauſe you have not the ſame reaſon to do it. Could any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon think, that there ſhould be ſuch Villains upon Earth, as impudently to Swear down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Treaſon againſt their fellow-Subjects, if there were no Truth in the Accuſation. That was the thing that guided thoſe Juries, who were all of them, no doubt, very honeſt men; and that was it, which influenc'd the Parliament to do what they did in the matter? For it was morally impoſſible to be thought, any ſuch Wickedneſs could be ſo publickly attempted.</p>
                  <p>But, God be thanked, the Eyes of all honeſt and underſtanding Men are opened. And we ſee the Fault was in our Credulity; and that theſe were Fellows ſhould not have been believ'd: And it concerns us, when the Truth has been ſo debauch't, and our Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity ſo impoſed upon, to ſhew the World our juſt Reſentment thereof.</p>
                  <p>And this I ſay to you, Gentlemen, with a purpoſe to vindicate thoſe Perſons, who were Concern'd as Jurors, in the Tryals of all thoſe Cauſes; becauſe that is the thing much harp'd upon, and aim'd at: That becauſe he was believed before, to diſ believe him now, would caſt a Reflection upon the Juries; whereas, if that Opinion hold, never will there be any ſuch thing as Perjury detected, ſo long as the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> endures. For if a Verdict be obtain'd upon falſe Teſtimony, and it ſhall be enough for the Witneſs to ſay; I was believed at ſuch a Tryal, and therefore pray do not you ofter to Proſecute me for Perjury: That would be the fineſt Doctrine that could be taught, to give a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe to deſtroy all Truths, Juſtice, and humane Society.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, I leave it home upon you: Upon your Conſciences be it; for, in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Great God of Heaven and Earth, that ſees all our Hearts, and will Judge us for our inward Thougths, at the laſt day; <hi>Liberavi animam meam.</hi> If you can find all theſe Perſons (in number <hi>Fortyſeven</hi>) Guilty of wilful, down right, malicious, and corrupt Perjury, then you muſt Acquit the Defendant.</p>
                  <p>For the particulars of the Evidence, which abound in many material Circumſtances, in point of Time and Place, I ſhall run them over as ſhort as I can, and re-mind you of them; not becauſe I think it extraordinary neceſſary, as though there were the leaft doubt of the Fact, but for the Satisfaction of all mankind, that are not under Invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble prejudice againſt the Truth. And I am ſure, upon yeſterdays Buſineſs, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained not any doubt, with any that heard it, ſave one, who I know had a great ſhare in the Deſign that was at the bottom of it; and I doubt, was one of thoſe Perſons that ſet this Villain on Work; his Name may be concealed for the preſent, but a few dayes will diſcover it here, or in ſome other place.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, What Mr. <hi>Attorney,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Soliciter General,</hi> or any of the King's Council have ſaid, or what the Defendant has ſaid for himſelf, if not proved, and made plain by Evidence, is to be no Guidance at all to you; who are only to go according to the Teſtimony given to you; for that is purſuant to your Oath; which Oath is the Rule of your Enquiry.</p>
                  <p>The Witneſſes that prove, that he did ſwear ſo in both the points in the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; I need not mention, they were ſo full: they tell you, he ſwore, that <hi>Ireland</hi> was in: Town from the <hi>Eighth</hi> to the <hi>Twelfth</hi> of <hi>Auguſt;</hi> but becauſe he fixed upon the <hi>Eighth</hi> at firſt, there was Caution given him, <hi>Be not ſo preciſe to a day, conſider with your ſelf.</hi> Then comes he to Stabb the buſineſs to the quick, and to Rivet it home<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:178846:27"/> If I cannot be poſitive to the <hi>Eighth,</hi> I will be poſitive between the <hi>Eighth</hi> and <hi>Twelfth.</hi> And as to the other point, I did obſerve before that, becauſe <hi>Bedloe</hi> was at a ſtand, upon <hi>Irelands</hi> denying his being in Town the latter end of <hi>August,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>September:</hi> Therefore comes <hi>Oats</hi> up again, to ſix it home; And, ſayes he, I am ſure he was in Town the <hi>Firſt</hi> or <hi>Second</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> becauſe he gave me <hi>Twe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ty Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings:</hi> That he ſwore this, is teſtifyed by three Gentlemen, who were <hi>Jury-Men</hi> at thoſe Tryals.</p>
                  <p>Now, that this is notoriouſly falſe, falſe to a tittle; and as Mr. <hi>Soliciter</hi> does obſerve, not the leaſt time left to give any ſort of Countenance to what he ſwore, is thus made out to you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> You are to take notice, that upon the <hi>Third</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> being <hi>Saturday,</hi> it is ſworn by three or four Witneſſes, That he went out of Town; and this is not ſworn as Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> gave his Evidence, poſitively without Circumſtances; but they give you an account, how they remember it; becauſe upon the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> before, which was a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick day of note among them, and alwayes kept as a Feſtival in memory of St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> upon the laſt day of <hi>July,</hi> as both they and Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> himſelf do affirm, there went Mr. <hi>Ireland,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Anne Ireland,</hi> and their Mother out of Town to a Friends houſe to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Mrs. <hi>Ireland</hi> did deſire him to ſtay there all night, as ſhe did No. ſayes he, I cannot ſtay all night, becauſe I muſt go out of Town on <hi>Saturday,</hi> and I muſt provide things neceſſary for my Journey: Nay, that is not all; for it goes yet further: Sayes his Siſter unto him, Why do you begin your Journey on a <hi>Saturday?</hi> that is an improper day: Oh! ſayes he, I do it, becauſe I am that night to go to my Lord <hi>Aſtor</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire;</hi> where I am to meet with Sir <hi>John Southcoat,</hi> and go down with them into the Country: This does the Mother ſwear, and the Siſter; and then the Maid ſervant, and the <hi>Taylors</hi> Wife, do give you another token, That it was <hi>Saturday</hi> the <hi>Third</hi> of <hi>Augrſt,</hi> becauſe he had ſomething to be mended in his Cloaths, and ſtay'd for them; and he was to go out of Town, for he had his Boots on.</p>
                  <p>There is yet this Circumſtance further, wherein thoſe four do all agree. That as he went, out of Town the <hi>Third</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> ſo he did not return till the <hi>Furteenth</hi> of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember;</hi> for they ſay, it was the <hi>Saturday</hi> fortnight before <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> and the ſame day of the Week that <hi>Michaelmas</hi>-day was of: So that you will find, that there is a conſtant proof, and as plain a one as any poſſible can, be in the World, as to the time of his going out, and coming home. And where he was in the mean time, proved directly by a great Company of Witneſſes, excent one day: For you ſee the <hi>Third</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> he went to my Lord <hi>Aſtons</hi> at <hi>Standen:</hi> Several there are that ſaw him there the <hi>Fourth,</hi> and din'd with him there; particularly, Sir <hi>Edward Southcoat.</hi> And to ſhew that it is not a thing they are poſitive in, and ſwear it roundly without Conſideration, they give you an Account of the Reaſons of their Knowledge. You are to conſider alſo the Teſtimony given by my Lord <hi>Aſton,</hi> a Perſon of great Honour and Quality; Sayes he. Tho' I dare venture all I am worth in the World upon the Truth of it, that <hi>Ireland</hi> did go along with me all the Journey; yet becauſe I did not take ſuch particular no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the reſt of the time, as I did of thoſe two dayes, I will not take upon me, to ſwear it: If Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> had had the Fortieth part of that Caution in his Evidence, I dare ſay, you had not had the trouble of this dayes Tryal.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Fifth,</hi> you have a great many Witneſſes, who give you an account that he came on <hi>Monday</hi> night to St. <hi>Albans</hi> with my Lord <hi>Aſton;</hi> there is Sir <hi>Edward, South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Southcoat,</hi> my Lord <hi>Aſton,</hi> the Goachman, and all the Servants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> tells you, that <hi>Monday</hi> was a hot day, and my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> took him into his Coach; but he rode a Horſe-back all the reſt of the way, and had a fine going Horſe; which Horſe Mr. <hi>John Southcoat</hi> bought of him when the whole Journey was ended. They tell you likewiſe, upon the <hi>Sixth</hi> and <hi>Seventh</hi> dayes, the very Inns they Lodged at upon the Road; and particularly at <hi>Northampton,</hi> they lay at the <hi>George,</hi> which was Sir <hi>William Farmers</hi>'s Houſe, which was then lett to an <hi>Inn-Keeper,</hi> becauſe of the Fire in that Town. And, which is moſt material of all, for <hi>Mr. Oats</hi>'s ſatisfaction, you have for theſe times no leſs than four Witneſſes, that are <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who give you the ſame account. There are in all no leſs in number than <hi>Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen</hi> to this point; and whether you will belive thoſe <hi>Fourteen</hi> to be witlfully perjured, without Evidence to the contrary, is left to you: And if they do ſwear true, <hi>Oats</hi> that was Yeſterday found Perjured, muſt be Convicted of Perjury again to day: For in ſhort, the Queſtion is, Whether you will believe Perſons of Credit, that have no ſtain upon their Reputation; or <hi>Oats</hi> that, upon plain Evidence, was found Guilty of Perjury Yeſterday?</p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:178846:28"/>
                  <p>When we come to <hi>Tixhall,</hi> we have no leſs number, that teſtifie where he was from day to day, and from night to night, to the <hi>Seventeenth,</hi> and from the <hi>Seventeenth</hi> to the <hi>Twenty-ſixth:</hi> You have <hi>Fifteen</hi> Witneſſes more, all as direct and poſitive, as can be in the World; Swearing where he was from time to time. It ſeems he came to <hi>Tix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall Thurſday</hi> the <hi>Eighth;</hi> there he ſtayed till <hi>Thurſday</hi> following, and then he went to <hi>Holy-Well;</hi> he lay the firſt Night at <hi>Nantwich;</hi> the next Night at <hi>Holy-Well,</hi> at the ſign of the Star, a Notorious Inn there; he came to <hi>Cheſter</hi> on <hi>Thurſday,</hi> and ſome of the Company left him there, but others came back with him to <hi>Tixhall;</hi> who ſay, he went away on <hi>Saturday</hi>-morning, which happens to be the <hi>Seventeenth.</hi> And thus you have a full account of him, quite from the <hi>Third</hi> to the <hi>Seventeenth,</hi> beyond all Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, plainly proved by Perſons of undoubted Credit. And if he were where they ſay he was from the <hi>Third</hi> to the <hi>Sevententh,</hi> How could <hi>Oats</hi> ſwear true, that he took his leave of him here in Town, between the <hi>Eighth</hi> and <hi>Twelfth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now let us come from the <hi>Seventeenth</hi> to the <hi>Twenty-ſixth,</hi> and you have no leſs than <hi>Fifteen</hi> Witneſſes, four whereof are <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> which I urge not as a neceſſary qualification to be a Witneſs, but to anſwer <hi>Oats</hi>'s Objection, as tho' this was a <hi>Popiſh</hi> deſign to deſtroy him. They have given you an account, where he was from time to time, by convincing Circumſtances, which you have heard particularly of one day, that he went to <hi>Litchfield;</hi> one of the Witneſſes went with him, and a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Witneſs too; that came back with him again, and ſupped with him at her Fathers Houſe. The <hi>Apothecary</hi> tells you, the day that he ſaw him was a Wake-day, which is a remarkable time in the Country. You are told of the Funeral of one Womans Mother, that made her ſtay away from <hi>Monday</hi> till <hi>Thurſday:</hi> Of another Mans Child. I mention them but ſhortly to you, becauſe I know you have taken Notes of them, and they are only uſed as Inftances to manifeſt the Integrity of the Witneſſes, that this was not a thing contrived on purpoſe to make a ſtory of, but did really happen in the Order they tell it. And I muſt remember you of another Circumſtance; Some of them do ſwear, that whereas <hi>Oats</hi> had a mind to evade their Teſtimony by that Queſtion, Whether this was the ſame <hi>Ireland</hi> that was Tryed? It was moſt certainly he; for that is made too evidently to appear, by their ſeeing him Executed at <hi>Tyburh;</hi> I am ſorry to ſay, Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently.</p>
                  <p>From the <hi>Third</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> to the <hi>Twenty-ſixth,</hi> there is not one night, but you hear where he was: And from the <hi>Twenty-ſixth</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> to the <hi>Seventh</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> you hear where he was at the Horſe-Match upon the <hi>Bowling-Green</hi> at <hi>Mr. Hereninghams, Mr. Lowes, Mr. Gerrards, Mrs. Cromptons, Mr. Pendrells, Mr. Giffords,</hi> and <hi>Mrs. Harwells:</hi> And from the <hi>Seventh</hi> to the <hi>Fourteenth,</hi> ſave only one day, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Eight,</hi> you have a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular account too; and it does not appear by a rambling Evidence, but a Faithful account is given of all the time, ſave that <hi>Eighth</hi>day; which ſhews the Caution of the Witneſſes. And it cannot but be eaſily preſum'd, he was either at <hi>Tixhall,</hi> or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, becauſe he was at <hi>Wolverhampton</hi> the <hi>Seventh;</hi> coming to <hi>London</hi> the <hi>Nineth.</hi> How eaſy is it to imagin him there the <hi>Eighth,</hi> and the rather, becauſe where he was the <hi>Eighth,</hi> is not material to the point in Queſtion before you, but where he was the <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Second?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> If in Caſe you had a mind to imagine, he was the <hi>Eighth</hi> at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> it muſt be by a ſtrain'd imagination: for you muſt take him to be at <hi>Wolverhamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> the <hi>Seventh,</hi> and make him Ride Poſt to <hi>London</hi> that Night, and return Poſt from <hi>London</hi> the <hi>Eighth</hi> to <hi>Tixhall,</hi> to be ready there early in the morning upon the <hi>Nineth,</hi> to take four dayes Journey back again; or elſe you cannot give the leaſt countenance to any other imagination, but that he was about <hi>Tixhall</hi> the <hi>Eighth</hi> of <hi>September.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well, at <hi>Tixhall</hi> you have him the <hi>Nineth</hi> of <hi>September;</hi> and from thence, you have it teſtified by all the Perſons that came along with him all the way, that he lay one Night at <hi>Coventry,</hi> another at <hi>Banbury,</hi> a third at <hi>Agmondiſham:</hi> That he Baited at <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>x<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg</hi> the <hi>Fourth,</hi> which was the <hi>Twelfth</hi> of <hi>September;</hi> and came to Sir <hi>John Southcoats</hi>'s Houſe that Night, being <hi>Thurſday:</hi> He ſtayed there <hi>Thurſday</hi>night, and <hi>Fryday;</hi> and upon <hi>Saturday</hi> the <hi>Fourteenth</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> Sir <hi>John Southcoates</hi>'s Man went along with him to <hi>London,</hi> whither he Rode upon the Horſe he ſold Mr. <hi>Southcoat;</hi> the Man ſaw him at his Lodging; and he ſayes, they wondred when he came in, that he had ſtayed ſo long.</p>
                  <p>And then we return to the Four Witneſſes they begun with at firſt; who makes all this Teſtimony to ſtand well together, That he went away the Third of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and was never in Town till the Fourteenth of <hi>September:</hi> And every Day, but the Eighth
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:178846:28"/> of <hi>September,</hi> which makes nothing to the Buſineſs, is particularly ſpoke to: And he muſt be there that Day too, except you will put him upon very hard Service, to ride Poſt to <hi>London,</hi> and back again, in Twenty four Hours; for no other Reaſon, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to commit a Treaſon, that none ever found out but Mr. <hi>Oats.</hi> And, I am ſure, if he did, he took a great deal of pains to a very little purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> I have taken up much of your Time, and detain'd you the longer in this matter; becauſe I cannot but ſay, with grief of Heart, Our Nation was too long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fotted; and of Innocent Blood, there has been too too much ſpilt: 'Tis high time, to have ſome Account of it. 'Tis a Mercy; we ought to bleſs <hi>Almighty God,</hi> for that we are prevented from ſpilling more Innocent Blood! <hi>God</hi> be bleſſed, our Eyes are opened; and let us have a Care, for the future, that we be not ſo ſuddenly impoſed upon by ſuch Prejudices and Jealouſies, as we have reaſon to fear, ſuch Villains have too much fill'd our Heads with, of late.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> 'Tis incumbent upon you, to Try according to the Evidence that has been given, whether the <hi>Defendant</hi> be <hi>Guilty,</hi> or <hi>Not Guilty.</hi> And 'tis incumbent upon us, that ſit here as Judges, to ſee the Law executed, as we will anſwer it at the Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of the <hi>Great Judge</hi> of Heaven and Earth, before whom we muſt appear, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our Tryals at the Great Day. And <hi>God</hi> forbid, but we ſhould uſe our utmoſt Endeavours, to inflict the greateſt Vengeance, that the Juſtice of the Nation can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit us to inflict upon ſuch Villains as theſe are; that have contracted ſo much Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief and Reproach upon us, and ſo much Guilt upon themſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> I am ſorry, I ſay, I have kept you ſo long: 'Tis a Caſe of ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, that I could not but ſay what I have done in it. There may be other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ariſing from the Evidence, which I may have omitted; but were very large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fully ſpoken to, by Mr. <hi>Soliciter.</hi> Whatſoever has been forgotten by him, or by me, I am ſure, will be ſufficiently ſupplyed by your own Obſervations: For I know you to be <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of great Knowledge and Experience in Matters of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Then the <hi>Jury</hi> withdrew, to Conſider of their <hi>Verdict;</hi> and, after half an Hours Receſs, return'd to the Bar; and, anſwering to their Names, deliver'd in their <hi>Verdict,</hi> That the <hi>Defendant</hi> was guilty of the <hi>Perjury</hi> whereof be ſtood Indicted: Which being Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, the <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice</hi> ſpoke to the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of the <hi>Jury,</hi> to this Effect.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
                  <p>Look ye, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> becauſe there has been ſome Notice taken to Day, as there was Yeſterday, concerning the Opinions of <hi>Judges,</hi> about <hi>Verdicts</hi> that have been given; I would ſay a Word or two to you: Not that I much admire the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, at any time; nor would I do it now, for your ſakes; becauſe, I am ſure, you act according to your Conſciences, and affect not Commendation: But becauſe it may be neceſſary, for the Satisfaction of ſome People, that they ſhould know our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions alſo in this Matter; I muſt tell you, You have given a <hi>Verdict,</hi> that becomes your Honeſty, Integrity, and Loyalty. And I declare, in the Preſence of <hi>Almighty God,</hi> the Searcher of Hearts, That had I been of the <hi>Jury,</hi> I muſt have given the ſame <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict. Gentlemen,</hi> 'Tis an Honoſt and Juſt <hi>Verdict,</hi> that you have given; and by it, you have Gontributed, as much as in you lies, to vindicate the Nation from the Infamy it has ſo long lain under.</p>

                  <p>For my part, I think, if you had given any other <hi>Verdict,</hi> you had found againſt plain Demonſtration; the Evidence was ſo full and clear.</p>

                        <item>I. That a Witneſs, Sworn in the behalf of the King, in a Proceſs of High-Treaſon cannot be puniſhed for Perjury by the King.</item>
                        <item>II. That it does not appear, that the Indictments of <hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp;c. found in <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex,</hi> were Legally Tranſmitted into <hi>London;</hi> and Conſequently, all the Proceedings thereupon, were <hi>Coram non Judice.</hi>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Attorney,</hi> What ſay you unto them?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Att. Gen.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>Truly my Lord, I think I need not ſay much to them; the firſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception is a plain Miſtake of the Indictment: For had Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> been Indicted upon the Statute, it had been ſomething; but at the Common-Law, certainly he may be Proſecuted by the King, though he was Witneſs for the King before. As to the Second, that it does not appear, <hi>Ireland</hi>'s Indictment was well tranſmitted from <hi>Middleſex</hi> to <hi>London;</hi> that ſure is well enough: For after it is Recited, that they were ſo and ſo Indicted, it does ſet forth, that the Tryals were had upon Records, there depending before the Commil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> and Jayl-Delivery; and it ſhall be taken, that they were well brought before them. As to the Third Exception, That the Perjuries Aſſigned are Forreign, to the Matter in Iſſue; that is not ſo: For it is apparent, one of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments is in the expreſs Point of the great Treaſon charg'd againſt them; that is, the Conſult of the 24th. of <hi>April.</hi> And as to the Second Indictment, it appeared up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Evidence, That there was a treaſonable Meeting ſworn in <hi>Auguſt;</hi> and he Swore <hi>Ireland</hi> was here in Town in the beginning of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and in the beginning of <hi>September.</hi> And then for the Fourth Matter, That he Swore he ſaw them Sign it; and the Perjury Aſſigned is, That he did not carry it to be Signed; that receives a plain anſwer: For we alledge, he falſly and corruptly Swore that he was preſent, and that he carried the Reſolution to be ſigned, and he ſaw them Sign the Refolution. Now, in theſe two things, we have laid the Perjury; 1. We ſay he was not there: And 2. He carried no ſuch Reſolution to be Signed: Indeed, we do not ſay that he did not ſee them Signed, nor we need not; for if he were not there, nor did carry it, he could not ſee them Sign it. There is nothing in the Exceptions, my Lord; and therefore I pray your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
                  <p>Is there any body of Councel for Mr. <hi>Oats,</hi> that will ſay any thing to theve Exceptions?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Oats.</speaker>
                  <p>I pray, my Lord, that I may have liberty but till <hi>Monday,</hi> for my Councel to prepare.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
                  <p>No, We cannot do it: Indeed, if there had been any colour or weight in the Exceptions, it might have been ſomething; though we have Indulg'd, in this Caſe already, more than ever we uſed to do, in Caſes of this nature; for it is known to every body, that knows any thing of the Courſe and Practiſe of the Court, That after Conviction, no more than four days are allowed to move in Arreſt of Judgment: And being the Practiſe of the Court, it is the Law of the Court; and I am ſure, as little favour ought to be ſhewn in a Caſe of Perjury, as in any Caſe whatfoever: But yet, however, becauſe he ſhould not think that the extremity of the Law was aimed at, by the Court in this Caſe, and he hindred in his legal Defence, the Court did indulge him time, more than is uſually granted in ſuch Caſes. Now, as for the Exceptions, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they are very frivolous.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Firſt,</hi> It would be admirable Doctrine indeed, in caſe it ſhould obtain, That if a Man be a Witneſs in any caſe for the King, and forſwear himſelf, he ſhould not be Proſecuted for Perjury at the King's Suit: For we know, that no Man can be Proſecuted for his Life, (except it be in Caſes of Appeal) but at the Suit of the King; and to be ſure, all Proſecutions for Treaſon, muſt be at his Suit. If then Witneſſes come and for ſwear themſelves, to take away mens Lives, and they ſhould not be called in queſtion for it, Criminally, by the King; That were a fine way to ſanctify the greateſt Villainy, and make the Proceſs of Law; to become an Inſtrument of the moſt infamous Cruelty in the World: I preſume, no Gentleman at the Bar would think that an Exception fit to put his hand to.</p>
                  <p>Then as to the <hi>Second,</hi> That the Perjury is not aſſigned in Points material to the Iſſue, that is plainly otherwiſe; for the time muſt needs be very material, becauſe it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:178846:30"/> that Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> could be Guilty of the Treaſon ſworn againſt him, at his Chamber in <hi>Ruſſel-Street,</hi> between the Eighth and Twelfth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> if he were not in Town between the Eighth and Twelfth of <hi>Auguſt:</hi> Nor could he be privy to the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſworn by <hi>Bedloe,</hi> the latter end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> in <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi>'s Chamber, if he were out of Town, from the Third of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> till the Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>September;</hi> and therefore both thoſe Perjuries were in the very Points in Iſſue.</p>
                  <p>And then for the Twenty-fourth of <hi>April,</hi> which is the main Perjury of all; It is not laid in this Indictment, That there was no Conſult of the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> upon that Day; nor is there any notice taken, That there was no Conſult at the <hi>White-Horſe-Tavern;</hi> but it ſayes only, that <hi>Oats</hi> did Swear, There was a Conſult there, and that he was preſent at it; and that he ſaw the Reſolution written down by <hi>Mico,</hi> if I do not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remember the Name: And that upon the Twenty-fourth of <hi>April,</hi> he went with it, from Chamber to Chamber, to have them Sign it. And then comes the Indictment, and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns the Perjury, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi Revera,</hi> he was not at the <hi>White-Horſe-Tavern</hi> that day; and I think it is pretty plain he was not, for he was then at St. <hi>Omers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then admitting all that matter about the Signing of the Reſolution, to be out of doors, a plain Perjury aſſign'd and prov'd. For it was moſt proepr for them to lay it as they did; and ſo it was in the other Point too, He Swore he carried the Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Chamber to Chamber, and ſaw it Signed. Now, ſay they, He did not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it, from Chamber to Chamber, to be Signed; and if ſo, then he could not ſee it Signed; and it will all be well enough ſure. And if any one part of the Oath he ſwore proves falſe, that is ſufficient to maintain this Verdict; and 'tis notoriouſly plain, it was Falſe throughout.</p>
                  <p>And of this Matter he now ſtands Convicted, upon as full and plain an Evidence, as ever was given, in any Caſe, in the World; and I am ſorry, to think, that any Man, who is Guilty of ſuch an Offence, ſhould continue ſo obſtinate, and hardned in Villainy, as he appears to be.</p>
                  <p>But I think it not amiſs for me to ſay ſomething upon this occaſion, for the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of ſome that hear me; and for an Example for the future. The Crime where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of this Man ſtands Convicted, is certainly a very heinous one, attended with ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Conſequences, that enſued upon it; that I think no Man can have a true Chriſtian Spirit in him, but he muſt begin to melt, with the Conſideration of the great Miſchiefs his Perjury has brought upon himſelf and us: It has brought the Guilt of Innocent Blood upon many; to be ſure it hath on his own head, and I pray God deliver all Men from having any hand in Innocent Blood.</p>
                  <p>And as the Crime is great, ſo it is to be known, that a proportionable puniſhment of that Crime, can ſcarce by our Law, as now it ſtands, be inflicted upon him. But that you may ſee we have conſidered how to puniſh it, as ſuch a Crime does deſerve: We have conſulted with all the <hi>Judges</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that if the Law would allow it, he might have ſuch a Judgment for this heinous Offence, as might be proper to terrifie all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from Committing the like again. For Puniſhment is not intended only for the ſake of the Offender, to reward him according to his deſerts; but it has a proſpect alſo of example and terrour to all others, that they ſhould take Care, how they offend in any ſuch manner, and that is as conſiderable a part of the end of the Law as any other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> It is known, that by the Old Laws of <hi>England,</hi> Perjury was Puniſhed with death; it grew a little more moderate afterwards, not to make the Crime the leſs, but becauſe of the danger there might be of malice in ſome revengeful Perſons, by endeavouring by Perjury to Convict others of Perjury. But the next ſtep was cutting out of the Tongue, to ſhew that the Law in all Ages had an abhorrency of falſe Oaths, and Puniſhed that impious Crime of Perjury, with the moſt terrible Puniſhments.</p>
                  <p>Since that time, Our Anceſtors have yet been more Moderate, and have not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Judgment to Life and Member, but by the Unanimous Opinion of all the <hi>Judges</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> whom we purpoſely conſulted with upon this Occaſion: It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, That by the Law, Crimes of this Nature, are left to be Puniſhed according to the diſcretion of this Court, ſo far as that the Judgment extend not to Life or Member.</p>
                  <p>And I tell you this <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> the rather becauſe <hi>I</hi> obſerve our Law-Books are more ſilent herein, in regard the Judgments for theſe Offences are not ſo ſolemnly and particularly entered up, as they are in Caſes Capital: But they are left more diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:178846:30"/> Becauſe, that Crimes of this Nature may be attended with particular Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, either to aggravate, or leſſen the Puniſhment: And therefore the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might be diſtributed accordingly.</p>
                  <p>And for that reaſon, <hi>Gemlemen,</hi> It is well known to us all, that that was the occaſion of taking away the Court of <hi>Star Chamber,</hi> as the Preamble of the Act for taking it away does manifeſt: That inaſmuch as the Authority, for the Correction of all Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences whatſoever, was by the Common Law of this Land, Originally fixed in the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench;</hi> and the Proceeding by information in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> when it might be by Proceſs in this Court, was lookt upon as a double way of Vexation: Therefore that Court is aboliſhed, and the Authority of the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> Court left entire. And it is notoriouſly known, how Puniſhments, of all ſorts and kinds, were inflicted by the Court of <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> for Perjury, and ſuch like Offences, while that Court was up; and ſince that time, in <hi>Fox</hi>'s Caſe, and others, that you have heard of, it has been according to the diſcretion of this Court, Puniſhed, as ſeverely as this Court thought fit, ſo as the Sentence did not extend to Life or Member.</p>
                  <p>Now I thought it proper for me, not only for the ſake of the Caſe now before us, but alſo for your Learning ſake, to tell you, This was the Reſolution of all the Judges of <hi>England,</hi> upon Conſideration of the Precedents, and of all the Rules of Law; which have been fully debated, and conſidered of: And this I declare, is their unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Opinion.</p>
                  <p>If then this be ſo, and it is left to the diſcretion of the Court. to inflict ſuch Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as they think fit; far be it from this Court, at any time, as on the one ſide, to inflict Puniſhment heavier, than the Crimes deſerve (no, we would rather uſe Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeration, than extraordinary and exorbitant Severity;) ſo, on the other ſide, to let go Crimes ſo notorious and hainous as theſe, without the ſevereſt mark that can, by Law, be put upon them. When a Perſon ſhall be Convicted of ſuch a foul and malicious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, as the Defendant here is, I think it is impoſſible for this Court, as the Law now ſtands, to put a Puniſhment upon him, any way proportionable to the Offence, that has drawn after it ſo many horrid and dreadful Conſequences: We do therefore think fit to inflict an exemplary Puniſhment upon this villainous Perjur'd wretch, to Terrify others for the future; which is not my part to pronounce: But what it is, my Brother will tell you.</p>

                     <hi>Titus Oats,</hi> You are Convicted upon <hi>Two Indictments</hi> for <hi>Perjury;</hi> I ſay, for <hi>Perjury:</hi> I muſt repeat the word twice, becauſe you are doubly Convicted. One of the greateſt Offences, that our Law has cognizance of; 'tis ſo in its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: But your <hi>Perjury</hi> has all the Aggravations that can be thought of, to heighten it. If a Man kills another with his Sword, and there be fore-thought Malice in the Caſe, he is to be hang'd for it: But when a Man ſhall draw Innocent Blood upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by a malicious, premeditated, falſe Oath, there is not only Blood in the Caſe; but likewiſe <hi>Perjury,</hi> corrupt, malicious <hi>Perjury:</hi> I know not how I can ſay, but, That the Law is defective, that ſuch a one is not to be hang'd. For, if we conſider thoſe dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Effects, which have follow'd upon your <hi>Perjury,</hi> we muſt conclude our Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective; they are vuch, as no Chriſtian's Heart can think of, without Bleeding for that Innocent Blood, which was ſhed by your Oath; and every knowing Man believes, and every honeſt Man grieves for. <hi>God</hi> be thanked, our Eyes are now opened; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, we muſt have been incurably blind, if they had not been opened firſt by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, Improbabilities, and Impoſſbilities in your own Teſtimony; but likewiſe, by the poſitive, plain, direct and full Proof of Forty ſeven Witneſſes, to one particular Point: Againſt whom you had not one world to object, but they were <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Roman Catholicks;</hi> which is no Objection at all: Though at the ſame, it did appear, that Nine or Ten of them were <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> That was all you had to ſay; you had not one Word, to juſtifie your ſelf from that great and hainous <hi>Perjury</hi> you were accuſed of. I hope, I have not been thought a Man of ill Nature; and, I
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:178846:31"/> confeſs, nothing has been ſo great a Regret to me, in my Place and Station, as to Give <hi>Judgment,</hi> and Pronounce the <hi>Sentence of Law</hi> againſt my Fellow-Subjects, my Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Creatures: But as to you, Mr. <hi>Oats,</hi> I cannot ſay, <hi>My Fellow-Chriſtian.</hi> Yet, in this Caſe, when I conſider your Offence, and the diſmal Effects that have follow'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, I cannot ſay, I have any Remorſe, in Giving <hi>Judgment</hi> upon you. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, having told you my Thoughts ſhortly, about your Crime, and how readily I Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce your <hi>Sentence;</hi> I ſhall now declare the Judgment of the <hi>Court</hi> upon you.
